# ADJUSTABLE RATE NOTE 

## (LIBOR One-Year Index (As Published In The Wall Street Journal)-Rate Caps)

![img-0.jpeg](img-0.jpeg)

1. BOHROWER'S PROMISE TO PAY

In return for a loan that I have received, I promise to pay U.S. $\mathbf{\$ 7 8 0 , 0 0 0 . 0 0}$ (this amount is called "Principal"), plus interest, to the order of the Lender. The Lender is LendSure Mortgage Corp., a Corporation.

I will make all payments under this Note in the form of cash, check or money order.
I understand that the Lender may transfer this Note. The Lender or anyone who takes this Note by transfer and who is entitled to receive payments under this Note is called the "Note Holder."

## 2. INTEREST

Interest will be charged on unpaid principal until the full amount of Principal has been paid. I will pay interest at a yearly rate of $\mathbf{6 . 8 2 5} \%$. The interest rate I will pay will change in accordance with Section 4 of this Note.

The interest rate required by this Section 2 and Section 4 of this Note is the rate I will pay both before and after any default described in Section 7(B) of this Note.

## 3. PAYMENTS

(A) Time and Place of Payments

I will pay principal and interest by making a payment every month.
I will make my monthly payment on the 1st day of each month beginning on July 1, 2017.
I will make these payments every month until I have paid all of the principal and interest and any other charges described below that I may owe under this Note. Each monthly payment will be applied as of its scheduled due date and will be applied to interest before Principal. If, on June 1, 2047, I still owe amounts under this Note, I will pay those amounts in full on that date, which is called the "Maturity Date."

I will make my monthly payments at P.O. Box 514707
Los Angeles, CA 90051-4707
or at a different place if required by the Note Holder.
(B) Amount of My Initial Monthly Payments

Each of my initial monthly payments will be in the amount of U.S. $\$ 4,994.43$. This amount may change.
(C) Monthly Payment Changes

Changes in my monthly payment will reflect changes in the unpaid principal of my loan and in the interest rate that I must pay. The Note Holder will determine my new interest rate and the changed amount of my monthly payment in accordance with Section 4 of this Note.

## 4. INTEREST RATE AND MONTHLY PAYMENT CHANGES

(A) Change Dates

The interest rate I will pay may change on the 1st day of June, 2024 and on that day every 12th month thereafter. Each date on which my interest rate could change is called a "Change Date."
(B) The Index

Beginning with the first Change Date, my interest rate will be based on an Index. The "Index" is the average of interbank offered rates for one-year U.S. dollar-denominated deposits in the London market ("LIBOR"), as published in The Wall Street Journal. The most recent Index value available as of the date 45 days before each Change Date is called the "Current Index," provided that if the Current Index is less than zero, then the Current Index will be deemed to be zero for purposes of calculating my interest rate.

If the Index is no longer available, the Note Holder will choose a new index which is based upon comparable information. The Note Holder will give me notice of this choice.
(C) Calculation of Changes

Before each Change Date, the Note Holder will calculate my new interest rate by adding FOUR percentage point(s) ( $\mathbf{4 . 0 0 0} \%$ ) (the "Margin") to the Current Index.
The Note Holder will then round the result of this addition to the nearest one-eighth of one percentage point ( $0.125 \%$ ). Subject to the limits stated in Section 4(D) below, this rounded amount will be my new interest rate until the next Clange Date.

# LOAN #: CAGENTITODING 

The Note Holder will then determine the amount of the monthly payment that would be sufficient to repay the unpaid principal that I am expected to owe at the Change Date in full on the Maturity Date at my new interest rate in substantially equal payments. The result of this calculation will be the new amount of my monthly payment.
(D) Limits on Interest Rate Changes

The interest rate I am required to pay at the first Change Date will not be greater than $\mathbf{8 . 6 2 5 \%}$ or less than $\mathbf{6 . 6 2 5 \%}$ Thereafter, my interest rate will never be increased or decreased on any single Change Date by more than TWO percentage point(s) ( $\mathbf{2 . 0 0 0 \%}$ ) from the rate of interest I have been paying for the preceding $\mathbf{1 2}$ month(s). My interest rate will never be greater than $\mathbf{1 1 . 6 2 5 \%}$ My interest rate will never be less than the start rate or $\mathbf{6 . 6 2 5 \%}$.
(E) Effective Date of Changes

My new interest rate will become effective on each Change Date. I will pay the amount of my new monthly payment beginning on the first monthly payment date after the Change Date until the amount of my monthly payment changes again.
(F) Notice of Changes

The Note Holder will deliver or mail to me a notice of any changes in my interest rate and the amount of my monthly payment before the effective date of any change. The notice will include information required by law to be given to me and also the title and telephone number of a person who will answer any question I may have regarding the notice.

## 5. BORROWER'S RIGHT TO PREPAY

I have the right to make payments of Principal at any time before they are due. A payment of Principal only is known as a "Prepayment." When I make a Prepayment, I will tell the Note Holder in writing that I am doing so. I may not designate a payment as a Prepayment if I have not made all the monthly payments due under the Note.

I may make a full Prepayment or partial Prepayments without paying a Prepayment charge. The Note Holder will use my Prepayments to reduce the amount of Principal that I owe under this Note. However, the Note Holder may apply my Prepayment to the accrued and unpaid interest on the Prepayment amount, before applying my Prepayment to reduce the Principal amount of the Note. If I make a partial Prepayment, there will be no changes in the due dates of my monthly payment unless the Note Holder agrees in writing to those changes. My partial Prepayment may reduce the amount of my monthly payments after the first Change Date following my partial Prepayment. However, any reduction due to my partial Prepayment may be offset by an interest rate increase.

## 6. LOAN CHARGES

If a law, which applies to this loan and which sets maximum loan charges, is finally interpreted so that the interest or other loan charges collected or to be collected in connection with this loan exceed the permitted limits, then: (a) any such loan charge shall be reduced by the amount necessary to reduce the charge to the permitted limit; and (b) any sums already collected from me which exceeded permitted limits will be refunded to me. The Note Holder may choose to make this refund by reducing the Principal I owe under this Note or by making a direct payment to me. If a refund reduces Principal, the reduction will be treated as a partial Prepayment.

## 7. BORROWER'S FAILURE TO PAY AS REQUIRED

(A) Late Charges for Overdue Payments

If the Note Holder has not received the full amount of any monthly payment by the end of $\mathbf{1 5}$ calendar day(s) after the date it is due, I will pay a late charge to the Note Holder. The amount of the charge will be $\mathbf{5 . 0 0 0} \%$ of my overdue payment of principal and interest. I will pay this late charge promptly but only once on each late payment.
(B) Default

If I do not pay the full amount of each monthly payment on the date it is due, I will be in default.
(C) Notice of Default

If I am in default, the Note Holder may send me a written notice telling me that if I do not pay the overdue amount by a certain date, the Note Holder may require me to pay immediately the full amount of Principal which has not been paid and all the interest that I owe on that amount. That date must be at least 30 days after the date on which the notice is mailed to me or delivered by other means.
(D) No Waiver By Note Holder

Even if, at a time when I am in default, the Note Holder does not require me to pay immediately in full as described above, the Note Holder will still have the right to do so if I am in default at a later time.
(E) Payment of Note Holder's Costs and Expenses

If the Note Holder has required me to pay immediately in full as described above, the Note Holder will have the right to be paid back by me for all of its costs and expenses in enforcing this Note to the extent not prohibited by applicable law. Those expenses include, for example, reasonable attorneys' fees.

## 8. GRING OF NOTICES

Unless applicable law requires a different method, any notice that must be given to me under this Note will be given by delivering it or by mailing it by first class mail to me at the Property Address above or at a different address if I give the Note Holder a notice of my different address.

Any notice that must be given to the Note Holder under this Note will be given by delivering it or by mailing it by first class mail to the Note Holder at the address stated in Section 3(A) above or at a different address if I am given a notice of that different address.

## 9. OBLIGATIONS OF PERSONS UNDER THIS NOTE

If more than one person signs this Note, each person is fully and personally obligated to keep all of the promises made in this Note, including the promise to pay the full amount owed. Any person who is a guarantor, surety or endorser of this Note is also obligated to do these things. Any person who takes over these obligations, including the obligations of a guarantor, surety or endorser of this Note, is also obligated to keep all of the promises made in this Note. The Note Holder may enforce its rights under this Note against each person individually or against all of us together. This means that any one of us may be required to pay all of the amounts owed under this Note.

# LOAN \& CAGON THOUGH 

## 10. WAVERS

I and any other person who has obligations under this Note waive the rights of Presentment and Notice of Dishonor. "Presentment" means the right to require the Note Holder to demand payment of amounts due. "Notice of Dishonor" means the right to require the Note Holder to give notice to other persons that amounts due have not been paid.

## 11. UNIFORM SECURED NOTE

This Note is a uniform instrument with limited variations in some jurisdictions. In addition to the protections given to the Note Holder under this Note, a Mortgage, Deed of Trust, or Security Deed (the "Security Instrument"), dated the same date as this Note, protects the Note Holder from possible losses which might result if I do not keep the promises which I make in this Note. That Security Instrument describes how and under what conditions I may be required to make immediate payment in full of all amounts I owe under this Note. Some of those conditions are described as follows:
If all or any part of the Property or any Interest in the Property is sold or transferred (or if Borrower is not a natural person and a beneficial interest in Borrower is sold or transferred) without Lender's prior written consent, Lender may require immediate payment in full of all sums secured by this Security Instrument. However, this option shall not be exercised by Lender if such exercise is prohibited by Applicable Law. Lender also shall not exercise this option if: (a) Borrower causes to be submitted to Lender information required by Lender to evaluate the intended transferee as if a new loan were being made to the transferee; and (b) Lender reasonably determines that Lender's security will not be impaired by the loan assumption and that the risk of a breach of any covenant or agreement in this Security Instrument is acceptable to Lender.

To the extent permitted by Applicable Law, Lender may charge a reasonable fee as a condition to Lender's consent to the loan assumption. Lender may also require the transferee to sign an assumption agreement that is acceptable to Lender and that obligates the transferee to keep all the promises and agreements made in the Note and in this Security Instrument. Borrower will continue to be obligated under the Note and this Security Instrument unless Lender releases Borrower in writing.

If Lender exercises the option to require immediate payment in full, Lender shall give Borrower notice of acceleration. The notice shall provide a period of not less than 30 days from the date the notice is given in accordance with Section 15 within which Borrower must pay all sums secured by this Security Instrument. If Borrower fails to pay these sums prior to the expiration of this period, Lender may invoke any remedies permitted by this Security Instrument without further notice or demand on Borrower.

Principal Amount: $\$ 600,000.00$
Interest Rate: $8.000 \%$
Date of Note: August 18, 2015

PROMISE TO PAY. Augustine M Lopez and Mathilda E Lopez ("Borrower") jointly and severally promise to pay to Rublcon Mortgage Fund, LLC, a California limited liability company as to an undivided 300,000/600,000 interest, whose address is 3575 Mt . Diablo Blvd., Suite 215, Lafayette, CA 94549 and Marin Capital, LLC, a California limited liability company as to an undivided 300,000/600,000 interest ("Lender"), or order, in lawful money of the United States of America, the principal amount of Sla Hundred Thousand \& 00/100 Dollars ( $\$ 600,000.00$ ), together with interest on the unpaid principal balance from date of funding, calculated as described in the "INTEREST CALCULATION METHOD" paragraph using an interest rate of $8.000 \%$, until paid in full. The interest rate may change under the terms and conditions of the "INTEREST AFTER DEFAULT" section.
PAYMENT. Borrower will pay this loan in 10 regular payments of $\$ 4,000.00$ each and one irregular last payment estimated at $\$ 604,000.00$. Borrower's first payment is due October 1, 2015, and all subsequent payments are due on the same day of each month after that. Borrower's final payment will be due on August 1, 2016, and will be for all principal and all accrued interest not yet paid. Payments include interest only. Unless otherwise agreed or required by applicable law, payments will be applied first to any accrued unpaid interest; then to principal; and then to any late charges. Borrower will pay Lender at Lender's address shown above or at such other place as Lender may designate in writing.
PAYMENT DETAILS. Monthly payments are to be issued as follows:
Rubicon Mortgage Fund, LLC $\$ 2,000.00$
Marin Capital, LLC $\$ 2,000.00$
Mail payments of Rubicon Realty Advisors, Inc., 3575 Mt. Diablo Blvd., Suite 215, Lafayette, CA 94549.
INTEREST CALCULATION METHOD. Interest on this Note is computed on a 30/360 simple interest basis; that is, with the exception of odd days before the first full payment cycle, monthly interest is calculated by applying the ratio of the interest rate over a year of 360 days, multiplied by the outstanding principal balance, multiplied by a month of 30 days. Interest for the odd days before the first full month is calculated on the basis of the actual days and a 360-day year. All interest payable under this Note is computed using this method.
PREPAYMENT. Borrower agrees that all loan fees and other prepaid finance charges are earned fully as of the date of the loan and will not be subject to refund upon early payment (whether voluntary or as a result of default), except as otherwise required by law. Except for the foregoing, Borrower may pay without penalty all or a portion of the amount owed earlier than it is due. Early payments will not, unless agreed to by Lender in writing, relieve Borrower of Borrower's obligation to continue to make payments under the payment schedule. Rather, early payments will reduce the principal balance due and may result in Borrower's making fewer payments. Borrower agrees not to send Lender payments marked "paid in full", "without recourse", or similar language. If Borrower sends such a payment, Lender may accept it without losing any of Lender's rights under this Note, and Borrower will remain obligated to pay any further amount owed to Lender. All written communications concerning disputed amounts, including any check or other payment instrument that indicates that the payment constitutes "payment in full" of the amount owed or that is tendered with other conditions or limitations or as full satisfaction of a disputed amount must be mailed or delivered to: Rubicon Realty Advisors, Inc.; 3575 Mt. Diablo Blvd., Suite 215; Lafayette, CA 94549.
LATE PAYMENT AND LATE CHARGE DEFINED. A payment will not be considered late if the envelope it is sent in has the proper remittance address, sufficient postage and a post mark date on or before the 11th of the month that the payment is due. If a payment is considered late, Borrower will be charged $10.000 \%$ of the unpaid portion of the regularly scheduled payment or $\$ 100.00$, whichever is greater.
INTEREST AFTER DEFAULT. Upon default, the interest rate on this Note shall, if permitted under applicable law, immediately become $18.000 \%$.
DEFAULT. Each of the following shall constitute an event of default ("Event of Default") under this Note:
Payment Default. Borrower fails to make any payment when due under this Note.
Other Defaults. Borrower fails to comply with or to perform any other term, obligation, covenant or condition contained in this Note or in any of the related documents or to comply with or to perform any term, obligation, covenant or condition contained in any other agreement between Lender and Borrower.
Default in Favor of Third Parties. Borrower or any Grantor defaults under any loan, extension of credit, security agreement, purchase or sales agreement, or any other agreement, in favor of any other creditor or person that may materially affect any of Borrower's property or Borrower's ability to repay this Note or perform Borrower's obligations under this Note or any of the related documents.
False Statements. Any warranty, representation or statement made or furnished to Lender by Borrower or on Borrower's behalf under this Note or the related documents is false or misleading in any material respect, either now or at the time made or furnished or becomes false or misleading at any time thereafter.
Death or Insolvency. The death of Borrower or the dissolution or termination of Borrower's existence as a going business, the insolvency of Loan

Borrower, the appointment of a receiver for any part of Borrower's property, any assignment for the benefit of creditors, any type of creditor workout, or the commencement of any proceeding under any bankruptcy or insolvency laws by or against Borrower.

Creditor or Forfeiture Proceedings. Commencement of foreclosure or forfeiture proceedings, whether by judicial proceeding, self-help, repossession or any other method, by any creditor of Borrower or by any governmental agency against any collateral securing the loan. This includes a garnishment of any of Borrower's accounts, including deposit accounts, with Lender. However, this Event of Default shall not apply if there is a good faith dispute by Borrower as to the validity or reasonableness of the claim which is the basis of the creditor or forfeiture proceeding and if Borrower gives Lender written notice of the creditor or forfeiture proceeding and deposits with Lender maries or a surely bond for the creditor or forfeiture proceeding, in an amount determined by Lender, in its sole discretion, as being an adequate reserve or bond for the dispute.
Events Affecting Guarantor. Any of the preceding events occurs with respect to any guarantor, endorser, surety, or accommodation party of any of the indebtedness or any guarantor, endorser, surety, or accommodation party dies or becomes incompetent, or revokes or disputes the validity of, or liability under, any guaranty of the indebtedness evidenced by this Note.
Adverse Change. A material adverse change occurs in Borrower's financial condition, or Lender believes the prospect of payment or performance of this Note is impaired.
Insecurity. Lender in good faith believes itself insecure.
Cure Provisions. If any default, other than a default in payment, is curable and if Borrower has not been given a notice of a breach of the same provision of this Note within the preceding twelve (12) months, it may be cured if Borrower, after Lender sends written notice to Borrower demanding cure of such default: (1) cures the default within fifteen (15) days; or (2) if the cure requires more than fifteen (15) days, immediately initiates steps which Lender deems in Lender's sole discretion to be sufficient to cure the default and thereafter continues and completes all reasonable and necessary steps sufficient to produce compliance as soon as reasonably practical.
LENDER'S RIGHTS. Upon default, Lender may declare the entire unpaid principal balance under this Note and all accrued unpaid interest immediately due, and then Borrower will pay that amount.
ATTORNEYS' FEES; EXPENSES. Lender may hire or pay someone else to help collect this Note if Borrower does not pay. Borrower will pay Lender that amount. This includes, subject to any limits under applicable law, Lender's attorneys' fees and Lender's legal expenses, whether or not there is a lawsuit, including attorneys' fees, expenses for bankruptcy proceedings (including efforts to modify or vacate any automatic stay or injunction), and appeals. Borrower also will pay any court costs, in addition to all other sums provided by law.
JURY WAIVER. To the extent permitted by applicable law, Lender and Borrower hereby waive the right to any jury trial in any action, proceeding, or counterclaim brought by either Lender or Borrower against the other.
GOVERNING LAW. This Note will be governed by federal law applicable to Lender and, to the extent not preempted by federal law, the laws of the State of California without regard to its conflicts of law provisions. This Note has been accepted by Lender in the State of California.
CHOICE OF VENUE. If there is a lawsuit, Borrower agrees upon Lender's request to submit to the jurisdiction of the courts of Contra Costa County, State of California.
COLLATERAL. Borrower acknowledges this Note is secured by the following collateral described in the security instrument listed herein: a Deed of Trust dated August 18, 2015, to a trustee in favor of Lender on real property located in Contra Costa County, State of California. That agreement contains the following due on sale provision: Lender may, at Lender's option, declare immediately due and payable all sums secured by the Deed of Trust upon the sale or transfer, without Lender's prior written consent, of all or any part of the Real Property, or any interest in the Real Property. A "sale or transfer" means the conveyance of Real Property or any right, title or interest in the Real Property; whether legal, beneficial or equitable; whether voluntary or involuntary; whether by outright sale, deed, installment sale contract, land contract, contract for deed, leasehold interest with a term greater than three (3) years, lease-option contract, or by sale, assignment, or transfer of any beneficial interest in or to any land trust holding title to the Real Property, or by any other method of conveyance of an interest in the Real Property. However, this option shall not be exercised by Lender if such exercise is prohibited by applicable law.
SUCCESSOR INTERESTS. The terms of this Note shall be binding upon Borrower, and upon Borrower's heirs, personal representatives, successors and assigns, and shall inure to the benefit of Lender and its successors and assigns.
GENERAL PROVISIONS. If any part of this Note cannot be enforced, this fact will not affect the rest of the Note. Lender may delay or forgo enforcing any of its rights or remedies under this Note without losing them. Each Borrower understands and agrees that, with or without notice to Borrower, Lender may with respect to any other Borrower (a) make one or more additional secured or unsecured loans or otherwise extend additional credit; (b) alter, compromise, renew, extend, accelerate, or otherwise change one or more times the time for payment or other terms of any indebtedness, including increases and decreases of the rate of interest on the indebtedness; (c) exchange, enforce, waive, subordinate, fail or decide not to perfect, and release any security, with or without the substitution of new collateral; (d) apply such security and direct the order or manner of sale thereof, including without limitation, any non-judicial sale permitted by the terms of the controlling security agreements, as Lender in its discretion may determine; (e) release, substitute, agree not to sue, or deal with any one or more of Borrower's sureties, endorsers, or other guarantors on any terms or in any manner Lender may choose; and (f) determine how, when and what application of payments and credits shall be made on any other indebtedness owing by such other Borrower. Borrower and any other person who signs, guarantees or endorses this Note, to the extent allowed by law, waive any applicable statute of limitations, presentment, demand for payment, and notice of dishonor. Upon any change in the terms of this Note, and unless otherwise expressly stated in writing, no party who signs this Note, whether as maker, guarantor, accommodation maker or endorser, shall be released from liability. All such parties agree that Lender may renew or extend (repeatedly and for any length of time) this loan or release any party or guarantor or collateral; or impair, fail to realize upon or perfect Lender's security interest in the collateral; and take any other action deemed necessary by Lender without the consent of or notice to anyone. All such parties also agree that Lender may modify this loan without the consent of or notice to anyone other than the party with whom the modification is made. The obligations under this Note are joint and several.

BORROWER COVENANTS that Borrower is lawfully seized of the estate hereby conveyed and has the right to grant and convey the Property and that the Property is unencumbered, except for encumbrances of record. Borrower warrants and will defend generally the title to the Property against all claims and demands, subject to any encumbrances of record.

THIS SECURITY INSTRUMENT combines uniform covenants for national use and non-uniform covenants with limited variations by jurisdiction to constitute a uniform security instrument covering real property.

UNIFORM COVENANTS. Borrower and Lender covenant and agree as follows:

1. Payment of Principal, Interest, Escrow Items, Prepayment Charges, and Late Charges. Borrower shall pay when due the principal of, and interest on, the debt evidenced by the Note and any prepayment charges and late charges due under the Note. Borrower shall also pay funds for Escrow Items pursuant to Section 3. Payments due under the Note and this Security Instrument shall be made in U.S. currency. However, if any check or other instrument received by Lender as payment under the Note or this Security Instrument is returned to Lender unpaid, Lender may require that any or all subsequent payments due under the Note and this Security Instrument be made in one or more of the following forms, as selected by Lender: (a) cash; (b) money order; (c) certified check, bank check, treasurer's check or cashier's check, provided any such check is drawn upon an institution whose deposits are insured by a federal agency, instrumentality, or entity; or (d) Electronic Funds Transfer.

Payments are deemed received by Lender when received at the location designated in the Note or at such other location as may be designated by Lender in accordance with the notice provisions in Section 15. Lender may return any payment or partial payment if the payment or partial payments are insufficient to bring the Loan current. Lender may accept any payment or partial payment insufficient to bring the Loan current, without waiver of any rights hereunder or prejudice to its rights to refuse such payment or partial payments in the future, but Lender is not obligated to apply such payments at the time such payments are accepted. If each Periodic Payment is applied as of its scheduled due date, then Lender need not pay interest on unapplied funds. Lender may hold such unapplied funds until Borrower makes payment to bring

# LOAN 8: <br> (CAGEON) 70051608 

the Loan current. If Borrower does not do so within a reasonable period of time, Lender shall either apply such funds or return them to Borrower. If not applied earlier, such funds will be applied to the outstanding principal balance under the Note immediately prior to foreclosure. No offset or claim which Borrower might have now or in the future against Lender shall relieve Borrower from making payments due under the Note and this Security Instrument or performing the covenants and agreements secured by this Security Instrument.
2. Application of Payments or Proceeds. Except as otherwise described in this Section 2, all payments accepted and applied by Lender shall be applied in the following order of priority: (a) interest due under the Note; (b) principal due under the Note; (c) amounts due under Section 3. Such payments shall be applied to each Periodic Payment in the order in which it became due. Any remaining amounts shall be applied first to late charges, second to any other amounts due under this Security Instrument, and then to reduce the principal balance of the Note.

If Lender receives a payment from Borrower for a delinquent Periodic Payment which includes a sufficient amount to pay any late charge due, the payment may be applied to the delinquent payment and the late charge. If more than one Periodic Payment is outstanding, Lender may apply any payment received from Borrower to the repayment of the Periodic Payments if, and to the extent that, each payment can be paid in full. To the extent that any excess exists after the payment is applied to the full payment of one or more Periodic Payments, such excess may be applied to any late charges due. Voluntary prepayments shall be applied first to any prepayment charges and then as described in the Note.

Any application of payments, insurance proceeds, or Miscellaneous Proceeds to principal due under the Note shall not extend or postpone the due date, or change the amount, of the Periodic Payments.
3. Funds for Escrow Items. Borrower shall pay to Lender on the day Periodic Payments are due under the Note, until the Note is paid in full, a sum (the "Funds") to provide for payment of amounts due for: (a) taxes and assessments and other items which can attain priority over this Security Instrument as a lien or encumbrance on the Property; (b) leasehold payments or ground rents on the Property, if any; (c) premiums for any and all insurance required by Lender under Section 5; and (d) Mortgage Insurance premiums, if any, or any sums payable by Borrower to Lender in lieu of the payment of Mortgage Insurance premiums in accordance with the provisions of Section 10. These items are called "Escrow Items." At origination or at any time during the term of the Loan, Lender may require that Community Association Dues, Fees, and Assessments, if any, be escrowed by Borrower, and such dues, fees and assessments shall be an Escrow Item. Borrower shall promptly furnish to Lender all notices of amounts to be paid under this Section. Borrower shall pay Lender the Funds for Escrow Items unless Lender waives Borrower's obligation to pay the Funds for any or all Escrow Items. Lender may waive Borrower's obligation to pay to Lender Funds for any or all Escrow Items at any time. Any such waiver may only be in writing. In the event of such waiver, Borrower shall pay directly, when and where payable, the amounts due for any Escrow Items for which payment of Funds has been waived by Lender and, if Lender requires, shall furnish to Lender receipts evidencing such payment within such time period as Lender may require. Borrower's obligation to make such payments and to provide receipts shall for all purposes be deemed to be a covenant and agreement contained in this Security Instrument, as the phrase "covenant and agreement" is used in Section 9. If Borrower is obligated to pay Escrow Items directly, pursuant to a waiver, and Borrower fails to pay the amount due for an Escrow Item, Lender may exercise its rights under Section 9 and pay such amount and Borrower shall then be obligated under Section 9 to repay to Lender any such amount. Lender may revoke the waiver as to any or all Escrow Items at any time by a notice given in accordance with Section 15 and, upon such revocation, Borrower shall pay to Lender all Funds, and in such amounts, that are then required under this Section 3.

Lender may, at any time, collect and hold Funds in an amount (a) sufficient to permit Lender to apply the Funds at the time specified under RESPA, and (b) not to exceed the maximum amount a lender can require under RESPA. Lender shall estimate the amount of Funds due on the basis of current data and reasonable estimates of expenditures of future Escrow Items or otherwise in accordance with Applicable Law.

The Funds shall be held in an institution whose deposits are insured by a federal agency, instrumentality, or entity (including Lender, if Lender is an institution whose deposits are so insured) or in any Federal Home Loan Bank. Lender shall apply the Funds to pay the Escrow Items no later than the time specified under RESPA. Lender shall not charge Borrower for holding and applying the Funds, annually analyzing the escrow account, or verifying the Escrow Items, unless Lender pays Borrower interest on the Funds and Applicable Law permits Lender to make such a charge. Unless an agreement is made in writing or Applicable Law requires interest to be paid on the Funds, Lender shall not be required to pay Borrower any interest or earnings on the Funds. Borrower and Lender can agree in writing, however, that interest shall be paid on the Funds. Lender shall give to Borrower, without charge, an annual accounting of the Funds as required by RESPA.

If there is a surplus of Funds held in escrow, as defined under RESPA, Lender shall account to Borrower for the excess funds in accordance with RESPA. If there is a shortage of Funds held in escrow, as defined under RESPA, Lender shall

# LOAN 8: CASIWITSSHIDE 

notify Borrower as required by RESPA, and Borrower shall pay to Lender the amount necessary to make up the shortage in accordance with RESPA, but in no more than 12 monthly payments. If there is a deficiency of Funds held in escrow, as defined under RESPA, Lender shall notify Borrower as required by RESPA, and Borrower shall pay to Lender the amount necessary to make up the deficiency in accordance with RESPA, but in no more than 12 monthly payments.

Upon payment in full of all sums secured by this Security Instrument, Lender shall promptly refund to Borrower any Funds held by Lender.
4. Charges; Liens. Borrower shall pay all taxes, assessments, charges, fines, and impositions attributable to the Property which can attain priority over this Security Instrument, leasehold payments or ground rents on the Property, if any, and Community Association Dues, Fees, and Assessments, if any. To the extent that these items are Escrow Items, Borrower shall pay them in the manner provided in Section 3.

Borrower shall promptly discharge any lien which has priority over this Security Instrument unless Borrower: (a) agrees in writing to the payment of the obligation secured by the lien in a manner acceptable to Lender, but only so long as Borrower is performing such agreement; (b) contests the lien in good faith by, or defends against enforcement of the lien in, legal proceedings which in Lender's opinion operate to prevent the enforcement of the lien while those proceedings are pending, but only until such proceedings are concluded; or (c) secures from the holder of the lien an agreement satisfactory to Lender subordinating the lien to this Security Instrument. If Lender determines that any part of the Property is subject to a lien which can attain priority over this Security Instrument, Lender may give Borrower a notice identifying the lien. Within 10 days of the date on which that notice is given, Borrower shall satisfy the lien or take one or more of the actions set forth above in this Section 4.

Lender may require Borrower to pay a one-time charge for a real estate tax verification and/or reporting service used by Lender in connection with this Loan.
5. Property Insurance. Borrower shall keep the improvements now existing or hereafter erected on the Property insured against loss by fire, hazards included within the term "extended coverage," and any other hazards including, but not limited to, earthquakes and floods, for which Lender requires insurance. This insurance shall be maintained in the amounts (including deductible levels) and for the periods that Lender requires. What Lender requires pursuant to the preceding sentences can change during the term of the Loan. The insurance carrier providing the insurance shall be chosen by Borrower subject to Lender's right to disapprove Borrower's choice, which right shall not be exercised unreasonably. Lender may require Borrower to pay, in connection with this Loan, either: (a) a one-time charge for flood zone determination, certification and tracking services; or (b) a one-time charge for flood zone determination and certification services and subsequent charges each time remappings or similar changes occur which reasonably might affect such determination or certification. Borrower shall also be responsible for the payment of any fees imposed by the Federal Emergency Management Agency in connection with the review of any flood zone determination resulting from an objection by Borrower.

If Borrower fails to maintain any of the coverages described above, Lender may obtain insurance coverage, at Lender's option and Borrower's expense. Lender is under no obligation to purchase any particular type or amount of coverage. Therefore, such coverage shall cover Lender, but might or might not protect Borrower. Borrower's equity in the Property, or the contents of the Property, against any risk, hazard or liability and might provide greater or lesser coverage than was previously in effect. Borrower acknowledges that the cost of the insurance coverage so obtained might significantly exceed the cost of insurance that Borrower could have obtained. Any amounts disbursed by Lender under this Section 5 shall become additional debt of Borrower secured by this Security Instrument. These amounts shall bear interest at the Note rate from the date of disbursement and shall be payable, with such interest, upon notice from Lender to Borrower requesting payment.

All insurance policies required by Lender and renewals of such policies shall be subject to Lender's right to disapprove such policies, shall include a standard mortgage clause, and shall name Lender as mortgagee and/or as an additional loss payee and Borrower further agrees to generally assign rights to insurance proceeds to the holder of the Note up to the amount of the outstanding loan balance. Lender shall have the right to hold the policies and renewal certificates. If Lender requires, Borrower shall promptly give to Lender all receipts of paid premiums and renewal notices. If Borrower obtains any form of insurance coverage, not otherwise required by Lender, for damage to, or destruction of, the Property, such policy shall include a standard mortgage clause and shall name Lender as mortgagee and/or as an additional loss payee and Borrower further agrees to generally assign rights to insurance proceeds to the holder of the Note up to the amount of the outstanding loan balance.

In the event of loss, Borrower shall give prompt notice to the insurance carrier and Lender. Lender may make proof of loss if not made promptly by Borrower. Unless Lender and Borrower otherwise agree in writing, any insurance proceeds,

whether or not the underlying insurance was required by Lender, shall be applied to restoration or repair of the Property, if the restoration or repair is economically feasible and Lender's security is not lessened. During such repair and restoration period, Lender shall have the right to hold such insurance proceeds until Lender has had an opportunity to inspect such Property to ensure the work has been completed to Lender's satisfaction, provided that such inspection shall be undertaken promptly. Lender may disburse proceeds for the repairs and restoration in a single payment or in a series of progress payments as the work is completed. Unless an agreement is made in writing or Applicable Law requires interest to be paid on such insurance proceeds, Lender shall not be required to pay Borrower any interest or earnings on such proceeds. Fees for public adjusters, or other third parties, retained by Borrower shall not be paid out of the insurance proceeds and shall be the sole obligation of Borrower. If the restoration or repair is not economically feasible or Lender's security would be lessened, the insurance proceeds shall be applied to the sums secured by this Security Instrument, whether or not then due, with the excess, if any, paid to Borrower. Such insurance proceeds shall be applied in the order provided for in Section 2.

If Borrower abandons the Property, Lender may file, negotiate and settle any available insurance claim and related matters. If Borrower does not respond within 30 days to a notice from Lender that the insurance carrier has offered to settle a claim, then Lender may negotiate and settle the claim. The 30-day period will begin when the notice is given. In either event, or if Lender acquires the Property under Section 22 or otherwise, Borrower hereby assigns to Lender (a) Borrower's rights to any insurance proceeds in an amount not to exceed the amounts unpaid under the Note or this Security Instrument, and (b) any other of Borrower's rights (other than the right to any refund of unearned premiums paid by Borrower) under all insurance policies covering the Property, insofar as such rights are applicable to the coverage of the Property. Lender may use the insurance proceeds either to repair or restore the Property or to pay amounts unpaid under the Note or this Security Instrument, whether or not then due.
6. Occupancy. Borrower shall occupy, establish, and use the Property as Borrower's principal residence within 60 days after the execution of this Security Instrument and shall continue to occupy the Property as Borrower's principal residence for at least one year after the date of occupancy, unless Lender otherwise agrees in writing, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, or unless extenuating circumstances exist which are beyond Borrower's control.
7. Preservation, Maintenance and Protection of the Property; Inspections. Borrower shall not destroy, damage or impair the Property, allow the Property to deteriorate or commit waste on the Property. Whether or not Borrower is residing in the Property, Borrower shall maintain the Property in order to prevent the Property from deteriorating or decreasing in value due to its condition. Unless it is determined pursuant to Section 5 that repair or restoration is not economically feasible, Borrower shall promptly repair the Property if damaged to avoid further deterioration or damage. If insurance or condemnation proceeds are paid in connection with damage to, or the taking of, the Property, Borrower shall be responsible for repairing or restoring the Property only if Lender has released proceeds for such purposes. Lender may disburse proceeds for the repairs and restoration in a single payment or in a series of progress payments as the work is completed. If the insurance or condemnation proceeds are not sufficient to repair or restore the Property, Borrower is not relieved of Borrower's obligation for the completion of such repair or restoration.

Lender or its agent may make reasonable entries upon and inspections of the Property. If it has reasonable cause, Lender may inspect the interior of the improvements on the Property. Lender shall give Borrower notice at the time of or prior to such an interior inspection specifying such reasonable cause.
8. Borrower's Loan Application. Borrower shall be in default if, during the Loan application process, Borrower or any persons or entities acting at the direction of Borrower or with Borrower's knowledge or consent gave materially false, misleading, or inaccurate information or statements to Lender (or failed to provide Lender with material information) in connection with the Loan. Material representations include, but are not limited to, representations concerning Borrower's occupancy of the Property as Borrower's principal residence.
9. Protection of Lender's Interest in the Property and Rights Under this Security Instrument. If (a) Borrower fails to perform the covenants and agreements contained in this Security Instrument, (b) there is a legal proceeding that might significantly affect Lender's interest in the Property and/or rights under this Security Instrument (such as a proceeding in bankruptcy, probate, for condemnation or forfeiture, for enforcement of a lien which may attain priority over this Security Instrument or to enforce laws or regulations), or (c) Borrower has abandoned the Property, then Lender may do and pay for whatever is reasonable or appropriate to protect Lender's interest in the Property and rights under this Security Instrument, including protecting and/or assessing the value of the Property, and securing and/or repairing the Property. Lender's actions can include, but are not limited to: (a) paying any sums secured by a lien which has priority over this Security Instrument; (b) appearing in court; and (c) paying reasonable attorneys' fees to protect its interest in the Property and/or rights under this Security Instrument, including its secured position in a bankruptcy proceeding. Securing the Property includes, but is not limited to, entering the Property to make repairs, change locks, replace or board up doors and windows, drain water

from pipes, eliminate building or other code violations or dangerous conditions, and have utilities turned on or off. Although Lender may take action under this Section 9, Lender does not have to do so and is not under any duty or obligation to do so. It is agreed that Lender incurs no liability for not taking any or all actions authorized under this Section 9.

Any amounts disbursed by Lender under this Section 9 shall become additional debt of Borrower secured by this Security Instrument. These amounts shall bear interest at the Note rate from the date of disbursement and shall be payable, with such interest, upon notice from Lender to Borrower requesting payment.

If this Security Instrument is on a leasehold, Borrower shall comply with all the provisions of the lease. Borrower shall not surrender the leasehold estate and interests herein conveyed or terminate or cancel the ground lease. Borrower shall not, without the express written consent of Lender, alter or amend the ground lease. If Borrower acquires fee title to the Property, the leasehold and the fee title shall not merge unless Lender agrees to the merger in writing.
10. Mortgage Insurance. If Lender required Mortgage Insurance as a condition of making the Loan, Borrower shall pay the premiums required to maintain the Mortgage Insurance in effect. If, for any reason, the Mortgage Insurance coverage required by Lender ceases to be available from the mortgage insurer that previously provided such insurance and Borrower was required to make separately designated payments toward the premiums for Mortgage Insurance, Borrower shall pay the premiums required to obtain coverage substantially equivalent to the Mortgage Insurance previously in effect, at a cost substantially equivalent to the cost to Borrower of the Mortgage Insurance previously in effect, from an alternate mortgage insurer selected by Lender. If substantially equivalent Mortgage Insurance coverage is not available, Borrower shall continue to pay to Lender the amount of the separately designated payments that were due when the insurance coverage ceased to be in effect. Lender will accept, use and retain these payments as a non-refundable loss reserve in lieu of Mortgage Insurance. Such loss reserve shall be non-refundable, notwithstanding the fact that the Loan is ultimately paid in full, and Lender shall not be required to pay Borrower any interest or earnings on such loss reserve. Lender can no longer require loss reserve payments if Mortgage Insurance coverage (in the amount and for the period that Lender requires) provided by an insurer selected by Lender again becomes available, is obtained, and Lender requires separately designated payments toward the premiums for Mortgage Insurance. If Lender required Mortgage Insurance as a condition of making the Loan and Borrower was required to make separately designated payments toward the premiums for Mortgage Insurance, Borrower shall pay the premiums required to maintain Mortgage Insurance in effect, or to provide a non-refundable loss reserve, until Lender's requirement for Mortgage Insurance ends in accordance with any written agreement between Borrower and Lender providing for such termination or until termination is required by Applicable Law. Nothing in this Section 10 affects Borrower's obligation to pay interest at the rate provided in the Note.

Mortgage Insurance reimburses Lender (or any entity that purchases the Note) for certain losses it may incur if Borrower does not repay the Loan as agreed. Borrower is not a party to the Mortgage Insurance.

Mortgage insurers evaluate their total risk on all such insurance in force from time to time, and may enter into agreements with other parties that share or modify their risk, or reduce losses. These agreements are on terms and conditions that are satisfactory to the mortgage insurer and the other party (or parties) to these agreements. These agreements may require the mortgage insurer to make payments using any source of funds that the mortgage insurer may have available (which may include funds obtained from Mortgage Insurance premiums).

As a result of these agreements, Lender, any purchaser of the Note, another insurer, any reinsurer, any other entity, or any affiliate of any of the foregoing, may receive (directly or indirectly) amounts that derive from (or might be characterized as) a portion of Borrower's payments for Mortgage Insurance, in exchange for sharing or modifying the mortgage insurer's risk, or reducing losses. If such agreement provides that an affiliate of Lender takes a share of the insurer's risk in exchange for a share of the premiums paid to the insurer, the arrangement is often termed "captive reinsurance." Further:
(a) Any such agreements will not affect the amounts that Borrower has agreed to pay for Mortgage Insurance, or any other terms of the Loan. Such agreements will not increase the amount Borrower will owe for Mortgage Insurance, and they will not entitle Borrower to any refund.
(b) Any such agreements will not affect the rights Borrower has - if any - with respect to the Mortgage Insurance under the Homeowners Protection Act of 1998 or any other law. These rights may include the right to receive certain disclosures, to request and obtain cancellation of the Mortgage Insurance, to have the Mortgage Insurance terminated automatically, and/or to receive a refund of any Mortgage Insurance premiums that were unearned at the time of such cancellation or termination.
11. Assignment of Miscellaneous Proceeds; Forfeiture. All Miscellaneous Proceeds are hereby assigned to and shall be paid to Lender.

If the Property is damaged, such Miscellaneous Proceeds shall be applied to restoration or repair of the Property. If the restoration or repair is economically feasible and Lender's security is not lessened. During such repair and restoration

# LOAN 6: CAGENTISS 1608 

period, Lender shall have the right to hold such Miscellaneous Proceeds until Lender has had an opportunity to inspect such Property to ensure the work has been completed to Lender's satisfaction, provided that such inspection shall be undertaken promptly. Lender may pay for the repairs and restoration in a single disbursement or in a series of progress payments as the work is completed. Unless an agreement is made in writing or Applicable Law requires interest to be paid on such Miscellaneous Proceeds, Lender shall not be required to pay Borrower any interest or earnings on such Miscellaneous Proceeds. If the restoration or repair is not economically feasible or Lender's security would be lessened, the Miscellaneous Proceeds shall be applied to the sums secured by this Security Instrument, whether or not then due, with the excess, if any, paid to Borrower. Such Miscellaneous Proceeds shall be applied in the order provided for in Section 2.

In the event of a total taking, destruction, or loss in value of the Property, the Miscellaneous Proceeds shall be applied to the sums secured by this Security Instrument, whether or not then due, with the excess, if any, paid to Borrower.

In the event of a partial taking, destruction, or loss in value of the Property in which the fair market value of the Property immediately before the partial taking, destruction, or loss in value is equal to or greater than the amount of the sums secured by this Security Instrument immediately before the partial taking, destruction, or loss in value, unless Borrower and Lender otherwise agree in writing, the sums secured by this Security Instrument shall be reduced by the amount of the Miscellaneous Proceeds multiplied by the following fraction: (a) the total amount of the sums secured immediately before the partial taking, destruction, or loss in value divided by (b) the fair market value of the Property immediately before the partial taking, destruction, or loss in value. Any balance shall be paid to Borrower.

In the event of a partial taking, destruction, or loss in value of the Property in which the fair market value of the Property immediately before the partial taking, destruction, or loss in value is less than the amount of the sums secured immediately before the partial taking, destruction, or loss in value, unless Borrower and Lender otherwise agree in writing, the Miscellaneous Proceeds shall be applied to the sums secured by this Security Instrument whether or not the sums are then due.

If the Property is abandoned by Borrower, or if, after notice by Lender to Borrower that the Opposing Party (as defined in the next sentence) offers to make an award to settle a claim for damages, Borrower fails to respond to Lender within 30 days after the date the notice is given, Lender is authorized to collect and apply the Miscellaneous Proceeds either to restoration or repair of the Property or to the sums secured by this Security Instrument, whether or not then due. "Opposing Party" means the third party that owes Borrower Miscellaneous Proceeds or the party against whom Borrower has a right of action in regard to Miscellaneous Proceeds.

Borrower shall be in default if any action or proceeding, whether civil or criminal, is begun that, in Lender's judgment, could result in forfeiture of the Property or other material impairment of Lender's interest in the Property or rights under this Security Instrument. Borrower can cure such a default and, if acceleration has occurred, reinstate as provided in Section 19, by causing the action or proceeding to be dismissed with a ruling that, in Lender's judgment, precludes forfeiture of the Property or other material impairment of Lender's interest in the Property or rights under this Security Instrument. The proceeds of any award or claim for damages that are attributable to the impairment of Lender's interest in the Property are hereby assigned and shall be paid to Lender.

All Miscellaneous Proceeds that are not applied to restoration or repair of the Property shall be applied in the order provided for in Section 2.
12. Borrower Not Released; Forbearance By Lender Not a Waiver. Extension of the time for payment or modification of amortization of the sums secured by this Security Instrument granted by Lender to Borrower or any Successor in Interest of Borrower shall not operate to release the liability of Borrower or any Successors in Interest of Borrower. Lender shall not be required to commence proceedings against any Successor in Interest of Borrower or to refuse to extend time for payment or otherwise modify amortization of the sums secured by this Security Instrument by reason of any demand made by the original Borrower or any Successors in Interest of Borrower. Any forbearance by Lender in exercising any right or remedy including, without limitation, Lender's acceptance of payments from third persons, entities or Successors in interest of Borrower or in amounts less than the amount then due, shall not be a waiver of or preclude the exercise of any right or remedy.
13. Joint and Several Liability; Co-signers; Successors and Assigns Bound. Borrower covenants and agrees that Borrower's obligations and liability shall be joint and several. However, any Borrower who co-signs this Security Instrument but does not execute the Note (a "co-signer"): (a) is co-signing this Security Instrument only to mortgage, grant and convey the co-signer's interest in the Property under the terms of this Security Instrument; (b) is not personally obligated to pay the sums secured by this Security Instrument; and (c) agrees that Lender and any other Borrower can agree to extend, modify, forbear or make any accommodations with regard to the terms of this Security Instrument or the Note without the co-signer's consent.

# LOAN \#: CAGON175551605 

Subject to the provisions of Section 18, any Successor in Interest of Borrower who assumes Borrower's obligations under this Security Instrument in writing, and is approved by Lender, shall obtain all of Borrower's rights and benefits under this Security Instrument. Borrower shall not be released from Borrower's obligations and liability under this Security Instrument unless Lender agrees to such release in writing. The covenants and agreements of this Security Instrument shall bind (except as provided in Section 20) and benefit the successors and assigns of Lender.
14. Loan Charges. Lender may charge Borrower fees for services performed in connection with Borrower's default, for the purpose of protecting Lender's interest in the Property and rights under this Security Instrument, including, but not limited to, attorneys' fees, property inspection and valuation fees. In regard to any other fees, the absence of express authority in this Security Instrument to charge a specific fee to Borrower shall not be construed as a prohibition on the charging of such fee. Lender may not charge fees that are expressly prohibited by this Security Instrument or by Applicable Law.

If the Loan is subject to a law which sets maximum loan charges, and that law is finally interpreted so that the interest or other loan charges collected or to be collected in connection with the Loan exceed the permitted limits, then: (a) any such loan charge shall be reduced by the amount necessary to reduce the charge to the permitted limit; and (b) any sums already collected from Borrower which exceeded permitted limits will be refunded to Borrower. Lender may choose to make this refund by reducing the principal owed under the Note or by making a direct payment to Borrower. If a refund reduces principal, the reduction will be treated as a partial prepayment without any prepayment charge (whether or not a prepayment charge is provided for under the Note). Borrower's acceptance of any such refund made by direct payment to Borrower will constitute a waiver of any right of action Borrower might have arising out of such overcharge.
15. Notices. All notices given by Borrower or Lender in connection with this Security Instrument must be in writing. Any notice to Borrower in connection with this Security Instrument shall be deemed to have been given to Borrower when mailed by first class mail or when actually delivered to Borrower's notice address if sent by other means. Notice to any one Borrower shall constitute notice to all Borrowers unless Applicable Law expressly requires otherwise. The notice address shall be the Property Address unless Borrower has designated a substitute notice address by notice to Lender. Borrower shall promptly notify Lender of Borrower's change of address. If Lender specifies a procedure for reporting Borrower's change of address, then Borrower shall only report a change of address through that specified procedure. There may be only one designated notice address under this Security Instrument at any one time. Any notice to Lender shall be given by delivering it or by mailing it by first class mail to Lender's address stated herein unless Lender has designated another address by notice to Borrower. Any notice in connection with this Security Instrument shall not be deemed to have been given to Lender until actually received by Lender. If any notice required by this Security Instrument is also required under Applicable Law, the Applicable Law requirement will satisfy the corresponding requirement under this Security Instrument.
16. Governing Law; Severability; Rules of Construction. This Security Instrument shall be governed by federal law and the law of the jurisdiction in which the Property is located. All rights and obligations contained in this Security Instrument are subject to any requirements and limitations of Applicable Law. Applicable Law might explicitly or implicitly allow the parties to agree by contract or it might be silent, but such silence shall not be construed as a prohibition against agreement by contract. In the event that any provision or clause of this Security Instrument or the Note conflicts with Applicable Law, such conflict shall not affect other provisions of this Security Instrument or the Note which can be given effect without the conflicting provision.

As used in this Security Instrument: (a) words of the masculine gender shall mean and include corresponding neuter words or words of the feminine gender, (b) words in the singular shall mean and include the plural and vice versa; and (c) the word "may" gives sole discretion without any obligation to take any action.
17. Borrower's Copy. Borrower shall be given one copy of the Note and of this Security Instrument.
18. Transfer of the Property or a Beneficial Interest in Borrower. As used in this Section 18, "Interest in the Property" means any legal or beneficial interest in the Property, including, but not limited to, those beneficial interests transferred in a bond for deed, contract for deed, installment sales contract or escrow agreement, the intent of which is the transfer of title by Borrower at a future date to a purchaser.

If all or any part of the Property or any Interest in the Property is sold or transferred (or if Borrower is not a natural person and a beneficial interest in Borrower is sold or transferred) without Lender's prior written consent, Lender may require immediate payment in full of all sums secured by this Security Instrument. However, this option shall not be exercised by Lender if such exercise is prohibited by Applicable Law.

If Lender exercises this option, Lender shall give Borrower notice of acceleration. The notice shall provide a period of not less than 30 days from the date the notice is given in accordance with Section 15 within which Borrower must pay all

sums secured by this Security Instrument. If Borrower fails to pay these sums prior to the expiration of this period, Lender may invoke any remedies permitted by this Security Instrument without further notice or demand on Borrower.
19. Borrower's Right to Reinstate After Acceleration. If Borrower meets certain conditions, Borrower shall have the right to have enforcement of this Security Instrument discontinued at any time prior to the earliest of: (a) five days before sale of the Property pursuant to any power of sale contained in this Security Instrument; (b) such other period as Applicable Law might specify for the termination of Borrower's right to reinstate; or (c) entry of a judgment enforcing this Security Instrument. Those conditions are that Borrower: (a) pays Lender all sums which then would be due under this Security Instrument and the Note as if no acceleration had occurred; (b) cures any default of any other covenants or agreements; (c) pays all expenses incurred in enforcing this Security Instrument, including, but not limited to, reasonable attorneys' fees, property inspection and valuation fees, and other fees incurred for the purpose of protecting Lender's interest in the Property and rights under this Security Instrument; and (d) takes such action as Lender may reasonably require to assure that Lender's interest in the Property and rights under this Security Instrument, and Borrower's obligation to pay the sums secured by this Security Instrument, shall continue unchanged. Lender may require that Borrower pay such reinstatement sums and expenses in one or more of the following forms, as selected by Lender: (a) cash; (b) money order; (c) certified check, bank check, treasurer's check or cashier's check, provided any such check is drawn upon an institution whose deposits are insured by a federal agency, instrumentality or entity; or (d) Electronic Funds Transfer. Upon reinstatement by Borrower, this Security Instrument and obligations secured hereby shall remain fully effective as if no acceleration had occurred. However, this right to reinstate shall not apply in the case of acceleration under Section 18.
20. Sale of Note; Change of Loan Servicer; Notice of Grievance. The Note or a partial interest in the Note (together with this Security Instrument) can be sold one or more times without prior notice to Borrower. A sale might result in a change in the entity (known as the "Loan Servicer") that collects Periodic Payments due under the Note and this Security Instrument and performs other mortgage loan servicing obligations under the Note, this Security Instrument, and Applicable Law. There also might be one or more changes of the Loan Servicer unrelated to a sale of the Note. If there is a change of the Loan Servicer, Borrower will be given written notice of the change which will state the name and address of the new Loan Servicer, the address to which payments should be made and any other information RESPA requires in connection with a notice of transfer of servicing. If the Note is sold and thereafter the Loan is serviced by a Loan Servicer other than the purchaser of the Note, the mortgage loan servicing obligations to Borrower will remain with the Loan Servicer or be transferred to a successor Loan Servicer and are not assumed by the Note purchaser unless otherwise provided by the Note purchaser.

Neither Borrower nor Lender may commence, join, or be joined to any judicial action (as either an individual litigant or the member of a class) that arises from the other party's actions pursuant to this Security Instrument or that alleges that the other party has breached any provision of, or any duty owed by reason of, this Security Instrument, until such Borrower or Lender has notified the other party (with such notice given in compliance with the requirements of Section 18) of such alleged breach and afforded the other party hereto a reasonable period after the giving of such notice to take corrective action. If Applicable Law provides a time period which must elapse before certain action can be taken, that time period will be deemed to be reasonable for purposes of this paragraph. The notice of acceleration and opportunity to cure given to Borrower pursuant to Section 22 and the notice of acceleration given to Borrower pursuant to Section 18 shall be deemed to satisfy the notice and opportunity to take corrective action provisions of this Section 20.
21. Hazardous Substances. As used in this Section 21: (a) "Hazardous Substances" are those substances defined as toxic or hazardous substances, pollutants, or wastes by Environmental Law and the following substances: gasoline, kerosene, other flammable or toxic petroleum products, toxic pesticides and herbicides, volatile solvents, materials containing asbestos or formaldehyde, and radioactive materials; (b) "Environmental Law" means federal laws and laws of the jurisdiction where the Property is located that relate to health, safety or environmental protection; (c) "Environmental Cleanup" includes any response action, remedial action, or removal action, as defined in Environmental Law; and (d) an "Environmental Condition" means a condition that can cause, contribute to, or otherwise trigger an Environmental Cleanup.

Borrower shall not cause or permit the presence, use, disposal, storage, or release of any Hazardous Substances, or threaten to release any Hazardous Substances, on or in the Property. Borrower shall not do, nor allow anyone else to do, anything affecting the Property (a) that is in violation of any Environmental Law, (b) which creates an Environmental Condition, or (c) which, due to the presence, use, or release of a Hazardous Substance, creates a condition that adversely affects the value of the Property. The preceding two sentences shall not apply to the presence, use, or storage on the Property of small quantities of Hazardous Substances that are generally recognized to be appropriate to normal residential uses and to maintenance of the Property (including, but not limited to, hazardous substances in consumer products).

# LOAN 8: CASZWITSSCHED 

Borrower shall promptly give Lender written notice of (a) any investigation, claim, demand, lawsuit or other action by any governmental or regulatory agency or private party involving the Property and any Hazardous Substance or Environmental Law of which Borrower has actual knowledge, (b) any Environmental Condition, including but not limited to, any spilling, leaking, discharge, release or threat of release of any Hazardous Substance, and (c) any condition caused by the presence, use or release of a Hazardous Substance which adversely affects the value of the Property. If Borrower learns, or is notified by any governmental or regulatory authority, or any private party, that any removal or other remediation of any Hazardous Substance affecting the Property is necessary, Borrower shall promptly take all necessary remedial actions in accordance with Environmental Law. Nothing herein shall create any obligation on Lender for an Environmental Cleanup.

NON-UNIFORM COVENANTS. Borrower and Lender further covenant and agree as follows:
22. Acceleration; Remedies. Lender shall give notice to Borrower prior to acceleration following Borrower's breach of any covenant or agreement in this Security Instrument (but not prior to acceleration under Section 18 unless Applicable Law provides otherwise). The notice shall specify: (a) the default; (b) the action required to cure the default; (c) a date, not less than 30 days from the date the notice is given to Borrower, by which the default must be cured; and (d) that failure to cure the default on or before the date specified in the notice may result in acceleration of the sums secured by this Security Instrument and sale of the Property. The notice shall further inform Borrower of the right to reinstate after acceleration and the right to bring a court action to assert the non-existence of a default or any other defense of Borrower to acceleration and sale. If the default is not cured on or before the date specified in the notice, Lender at its option may require immediate payment in full of all sums secured by this Security Instrument without further demand and may invoke the power of sale and any other remedies permitted by Applicable Law. Lender shall be entitled to collect all expenses incurred in pursuing the remedies provided in this Section 22, including, but not limited to, reasonable attorneys' fees and costs of title evidence.

If Lender invokes the power of sale, Lender shall execute or cause Trustee to execute a written notice of the occurrence of an event of default and of Lender's election to cause the Property to be sold. Trustee shall cause this notice to be recorded in each county in which any part of the Property is located. Lender or Trustee shall mail copies of the notice as prescribed by Applicable Law to Borrower and to the other persons prescribed by Applicable Law. Trustee shall give public notice of sale to the persons and in the manner prescribed by Applicable Law. After the time required by Applicable Law, Trustee, without demand on Borrower, shall sell the Property at public auction to the highest bidder at the time and place and under the terms designated in the notice of sale in one or more parcels and in any order Trustee determines. Trustee may postpone sale of all or any parcel of the Property by public announcement at the time and place of any previously scheduled sale. Lender or its designee may purchase the Property at any sale.

Trustee shall deliver to the purchaser Trustee's deed conveying the Property without any covenant or warranty, expressed or implied. The rectisis in the Trustee's deed shall be prima facie evidence of the truth of the statements made therein. Trustee shall apply the proceeds of the sale in the following order: (a) to all expenses of the sale, including, but not limited to, reasonable Trustee's and attorneys' fees; (b) to all sums secured by this Security Instrument; and (c) any excess to the person or persons legally entitled to it.
23. Reconvoyance. Upon payment of all sums secured by this Security Instrument, Lender shall request Trustee to reconvey the Property and shall surrender this Security Instrument and all notes evidencing debt secured by this Security Instrument to Trustee. Trustee shall reconvey the Property without warranty to the person or persons legally entitled to it. Lender may charge such person or persons a reasonable fee for reconveying the Property, but only if the fee is paid to a third party (such as the Trustee) for services rendered and the charging of the fee is permitted under Applicable Law. If the fee charged does not exceed the fee set by Applicable Law, the fee is conclusively presumed to be reasonable.
24. Substitute Trustee. Lender, at its option, may from time to time appoint a successor trustee to any Trustee appointed hereunder by an instrument executed and acknowledged by Lender and recorded in the office of the Recorder of the county in which the Property is located. The instrument shall contain the name of the original Lender, Trustee and Borrower, the book and page where this Security Instrument is recorded and the name and address of the successor trustee. Without conveyance of the Property, the successor trustee shall succeed to all the title, powers and duties conferred upon the Trustee herein and by Applicable Law. This procedure for substitution of trustee shall govern to the exclusion of all other provisions for substitution.
25. Statement of Obligation Fee. Lender may collect a fee not to exceed the maximum amount permitted by Applicable Law for furnishing the statement of obligation as provided by Section 2943 of the Civil Code of California.

# ADJUSTABLE RATE RIDER 

## (LIBOR One-Year Index (As Published In The Wall Street Journal-Rate Caps)

THIS ADJUSTABLE RATE RIDER is made this 28th day of May, 2017, and is incorporated into and shall be deemed to amend and supplement the Mortgage, Deed of Trust, or Security Deed (the "Security Instrument") of the same date given by the undersigned (the "Borrower") to secure Borrower's Adjustable Rate Note (the "Note") to LendSure Mortgage Corp., a Corporation
(the "Lender") of the same date and covering the property described in the Security Instrument and located at: 1005 Lake Dose Danville, CA 94526.

## THE NOTE CONTAINS PROVISIONS ALLOWING FOR CHANGES IN THE INTEREST RATE AND THE MONTHLY PAYMENT. THE NOTE LIMITS THE AMOUNT THE BORROWER'S INTEREST RATE CAN CHANGE AT ANY ONE TIME AND THE MINIMUM AND MAXIMUM RATES THE BORROWER MUST PAY.

ADDITIONAL COVENANTS. In addition to the covenants and agreements made in the Security Instrument, Borrower and Lender further covenant and agree as follows:

## A. INTEREST RATE AND MONTHLY PAYMENT CHANGES

The Note provides for an initial interest rate of $6.625 \%$. The Note provides for changes in the interest rate and the monthly payments as follows:

## 4. INTEREST RATE AND MONTHLY PAYMENT CHANGES

(A) Change Dates

The interest rate I will pay may change on the 1st day of June, 2024, and on that day every 12th month thereafter. Each date on which my interest rate could change is called a "Change Date."
(B) The Index

Beginning with the first Change Date, my interest rate will be based on an Index. The "Index" is the average of interbank offered rates for one-year U.S. dollar-denominated

deposits in the London market ("LIBOR"), as published in The Wall Street Journal. The most recent Index value available as of the date 45 days before each Change Date is called the "Current Index," provided that if the Current Index is less than zero, then the Current Index will be deemed to be zero for purposes of calculating my interest rate.

If the Index is no longer available, the Note Holder will choose a new index which is based upon comparable information. The Note Holder will give me notice of this choice.
(C) Calculation of Changes

Before each Change Date, the Note Holder will calculate my new interest rate by adding FOUR percentage point(s) ( $4.000 \%$ ) (the "Margin") to the Current Index. The Note Holder will then round the result of this addition to the nearest one-eighth of one percentage point ( $0.125 \%$ ). Subject to the limits stated in Section 4(D) below, this rounded amount will be my new interest rate until the next Change Date.

The Note Holder will then determine the amount of the monthly payment that would be sufficient to repay the unpaid principal that I am expected to owe at the Change Date in full on the maturity date at my new interest rate in substantially equal payments. The result of this calculation will be the new amount of my monthly payment.
(D) Limits on Interest Rate Changes

The interest rate I am required to pay at the first Change Date will not be greater than $8.625 \%$ or less than $6.625 \%$. Thereafter, my interest rate will never be increased or decreased on any single Change Date by more than TWO percentage point(s) ( $2.000 \%$ ) from the rate of interest I have been paying for the preceding $\mathbf{1 2}$ month(s). My interest rate will never be greater than $11.625 \%$. My interest rate will never be less than the start rate or 6.625 $\%$.
(E) Effective Date of Changes

My new interest rate will become effective on each Change Date. I will pay the amount of my new monthly payment beginning on the first monthly payment date after the Change Date until the amount of my monthly payment changes again.
(F) Notice of Changes

The Note Holder will deliver or mail to me a notice of any changes in my interest rate and the amount of my monthly payment before the effective date of any change. The notice will include information required by law to be given to me and also the title

# B. TRANSFER OF THE PROPERTY OR A BENEFICIAL INTEREST IN BORROWER 

Section 18 of the Security Instrument is amended to read as follows:
Transfer of the Property or a Beneficial Interest in Borrower. As used in this Section 18, "Interest in the Property" means any legal or beneficial interest in the Property, including, but not limited to, those beneficial interests transferred in a bond for deed, contract for deed, installment sales contract or escrow agreement, the intent of which is the transfer of title by Borrower at a future date to a purchaser.

If all or any part of the Property or any Interest in the Property is sold or transferred (or if Borrower is not a natural person and a beneficial interest in Borrower is sold or transferred) without Lender's prior written consent, Lender may require immediate payment in full of all sums secured by this Security instrument. However, this option shall not be exercised by Lender if such exercise is prohibited by Applicable Law. Lender also shall not exercise this option if: (a) Borrower causes to be submitted to Lender information required by Lender to evaluate the intended transferee as if a new loan were being made to the transferee; and (b) Lender reasonably determines that Lender's security will not be impaired by the loan assumption and that the risk of a breach of any covenant or agreement in this Security Instrument is acceptable to Lender.

To the extent permitted by Applicable Law, Lender may charge a reasonable fee as a condition to Lender's consent to the loan assumption. Lender may also require the transferee to sign an assumption agreement that is acceptable to Lender and that obligates the transferee to keep all the promises and agreements made in the Note and in this Security Instrument. Borrower will continue to be obligated under the Note and this Security Instrument unless Lender releases Borrower in writing.

If Lender exercises the option to require immediate payment in full, Lender shall give Borrower notice of acceleration. The notice shall provide a period of not less than 30 days from the date the notice is given in accordance with Section 15 within which Borrower must pay all sums secured by this Security Instrument. If Borrower fails to pay these sums prior to the expiration of this period, Lender may invoke any remedies permitted by this Security Instrument without further notice or demand on Borrower.

## EXPOSURE TIME

Opinion of reasonable Exposure Time: Less than 30 days.
The appraiser certifies and agrees that this appraisal report was prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Title XI of the FIRREA of 3989 (12 U.S.C. 3331 et seq.) and any applicable implementing regulations in effect at the time the appraiser signs the certification.

This report form is designed to report an appraisal of a one-unit property or a one-unit property with an accessory unit, including a unit in a planned unit development (PUD). This report form is not designed to report an appraisal of a manufactured home or a unit in a condominium or cooperative project.

This appraisal report is subject to the following scope of work, intended use, intended user, definition of market value, statement of assumptions and limiting conditions, and certifications. Modifications, additions, or deletions to the intended use, intended user, definition of market value, or assumptions and limiting conditions are not permitted. The appraiser may expand the scope of work to include any additional research or analysis necessary based on the complexity of this appraisal assignment. Modifications or deletions to the certifications are also not permitted. However, additional certifications that do not constitute material alterations to this appraisal report, such as those required by law or those related to the appraiser's continuing education or membership in an appraisal organization, are permitted.

SCOPE OF WORK: The scope of work for this appraisal is defined by the complexity of this appraisal assignment and the reporting requirements of this appraisal report form, including the following definition of market value, statement of assumptions and limiting conditions, and certifications. The appraiser must, at a minimum: (1) perform a complete visual inspection of the interior and exterior areas of the subject property, (2) inspect the neighborhood, (3) inspect each of the comparable sales from at least the street, (4) research, verify, and analyze data from reliable public and/or private sources, and (5) report his or her analysis, opinions, and conclusions in this appraisal report.

INTENDED USE: The intended use of this appraisal report is for the lender/client to evaluate the property that is the subject of this appraisal for a mortgage finance transaction.

INTENDED USER: The intended user of this appraisal report is the lender/client.

DEFINITION OF MARKET VALUE: The most probable price which a property should bring in a competitive and open market under all conditions requisite to a fair sale, the buyer and seller, each acting prudently, knowledgeably and assuming the price is not affected by undue stimulus. Implicit in this definition is the consummation of a sale as of a specified date and the passing of title from seller to buyer under conditions whereby: (1) buyer and seller are typically motivated; (2) both parties are well informed or well advised, and each acting in what he or she considers his or her own best interest; (3) a reasonable time is allowed for exposure in the open market; (4) payment is made in terms of cash in U. S. dollars or in terms of financial arrangements comparable thematic and (5) the price represents the normal consideration for the property sold unaffected by special or creative financing or sales concessions* granted by anyone associated with the sale.
*Adjustments to the comparables must be made for special or creative financing or sales concessions. No adjustments are necessary for those costs which are normally paid by sellers as a result of tradition or law in a market area; those costs are readily identifiable since the seller pays these costs in virtually all sales transactions. Special or creative financing adjustments can be made to the comparable property by comparisons to financing terms offered by a third party institutional lender that is not already involved in the property or transaction. Any adjustment should not be calculated on a mechanical dollar for dollar cost of the financing or concession but the dollar amount of any adjustment should approximate the market's reaction to the financing or concessions based on the appraiser's judgment.

STATEMENT OF ASSUMPTIONS AND LIMITING CONDITIONS: The appraiser's certification in this report is subject to the following assumptions and limiting conditions:

1. The appraiser will not be responsible for matters of a legal nature that affect either the property being appraised or the title to it, except for information that he or she became aware of during the research involved in performing this appraisal. The appraiser assumes that the title is good and marketable and will not render any opinions about the title.
2. The appraiser has provided a sketch in this appraisal report to show the approximate dimensions of the improvements. The sketch is included only to assist the reader in visualizing the property and understanding the appraiser's determination of its size.
3. The appraiser has examined the available flood maps that are provided by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (or other data sources) and has noted in this appraisal report whether any portion of the subject site is located in an identified Special Flood Hazard Area. Because the appraiser is not a surveyor, he or she makes no guarantees, express or implied, regarding this determination.
4. The appraiser will not give testimony or appear in court because he or she made an appraisal of the property in question, unless specific arrangements to do so have been made beforehand, or as otherwise required by law.
5. The appraiser has noted in this appraisal report any adverse conditions (such as needed repairs, deterioration, the presence of hazardous wastes, toxic substances, etc.) observed during the inspection of the subject property or that he or she became aware of during the research involved in performing the appraisal. Unless otherwise stated in this appraisal report, the appraiser has no knowledge of any hidden or unapparent physical deficiencies or adverse conditions of the property (such as, but not limited to, needed repairs, deterioration, the presence of hazardous wastes, toxic substances, adverse environmental conditions, etc.) that would make the property less valuable, and has assumed that there are no such conditions and makes no guarantees or warranties, express or implied. The appraiser will not be responsible for any such conditions that do exist or for any engineering or testing that might be required to discover whether such conditions exist. Because the appraiser is not an expert in the field of environmental hazards, this appraisal report must not be considered as an environmental assessment of the property.
6. The appraiser has based his or her appraisal report and valuation conclusion for an appraisal that is subject to satisfactory completion, repairs, or alterations on the assumption that the completion, repairs, or alterations of the subject property will be performed in a professional manner.

APPRIABEING CERTIFICATION: The Appraiser certifies and agrees that:

1. I have, at a minimum, developed and reported this appraisal in accordance with the scope of work requirements stated in this appraisal report.
2. I performed a complete visual inspection of the interior and exterior areas of the subject property. I reported the condition of the improvements in factual, specific terms.

4. I developed my opinion of the market value of the real property that is the subject of this report based on the sales comparison approach to value. I have adequate comparable market data to develop a reliable sales comparison approach for this appraisal assignment.

5. I researched, verified, analyzed, and reported on any current agreement for sale for the subject property, any offering for sale of the subject property in the twelve months prior to the effective date of this appraisal, and the prior sales of the subject property for a minimum of three years prior to the effective date of this appraisal, unless otherwise indicated in this report.
6. I researched, verified, analyzed, and reported on the prior sales of the comparable sales for a minimum of one year prior to the date of sale of the comparable sale, unless otherwise indicated in this report.
7. I selected and used comparable sales that are locationally, physically, and functionally the most similar to the subject property.
8. I have not used comparable sales that were the result of containing a land sale with the contract purchase price of a home that has been built or will be built on the land.
9. I have reported adjustments to the comparable sales that reflect the market's reaction to the differences between the subject property and the comparable sales.
10. I verified, from a disinterested source, all information in this report that was provided by parties who have a financial interest in the sale or financing of the subject property.
11. I have knowledge and experience in appraising this type of property in this market area.
12. I am aware of, and have access to, the necessary and appropriate public and private data sources, such as multiple listing services, tax assessment records, public land records and other such data sources for the area in which the property is located.
13. I obtained the information, estimates, and opinions furnished by other parties and expressed in this appraisal report from reliable sources that I believe to be true and correct.
14. I have taken into consideration the factors that have an impact on value with respect to the subject neighborhood, subject property, and the proximity of the subject property to adverse influences in the development of my opinion of market value. I have noted in this appraisal report any adverse conditions (such as, but not limited to, needed repairs, deterioration, the presence of hazardous wastes, toxic substances, adverse environmental conditions, etc.) observed during the inspection of the subject property or that I became aware of during the research involved in performing this appraisal. I have considered these adverse conditions in my analysis of the property value, and have reported on the effect of the conditions on the value and marketability of the subject property.
15. I have not knowingly withheld any significant information from this appraisal report and, to the best of my knowledge, all statements and information in this appraisal report are true and correct.
16. I stated in this appraisal report my own personal, unbiased, and professional analysis, opinions, and conclusions, which are subject only to the assumptions and limiting conditions in this appraisal report.

# URAR: Reconciliation - Reconciliation and Final Value Conclusion 

The sales comparison approach is given the most weight in the final estimate of value as it best reflects the typical actions of buyers and sellers in the open marketplace, providing the best indication of market value.

Comparable \# 1 provided the most weight, brackets GLA, lot size, and room count.
Comparable \#2 provided secondary support bracketing GLA and room count, Listing \#1 provides good supplemental support.
The cost approach provides good support.
The subject shows as a 4 bedroom, 2 bathroom, 1 story ranch styled dwelling in overall average good condition.
The cost approach attempted at request of client, but due to the limited availability of residential land sales the appraiser applied the abstraction method for opinion of site value. A pool of similar, recent residential zoned sales in search area of similar lot size and utility were not available at time of the effective date of report.

Income approach not developed as it does not provide reliable support of subject's single family residential use.

## Condition Ratings and Definitions

C1
The improvements have been recently constructed and have not been previously occupied. The entire structure and all components are new and the dwelling features no physical depreciation.

Note: Newly constructed improvements that feature recycled or previously used materials and/or components can be considered new dwellings provided that the dwelling is placed on a 100 percent new foundation and the recycled materials and the recycled components have been rehabilitated/renourufactured into like-new condition. Improvements that have not been previously occupied are not considered "new" if they have any significant physical depreciation (that is, newly constructed dwellings that have been vacant for an extended period of time without adequate maintenance or upkeep).

C2
The improvements feature no deferred maintenance, little or no physical depreciation, and require no repairs. Virtually all building components are new or have been recently repaired, refinished, or rehabilitated. All outdated components and finishes have been updated and/or replaced with components that meet current standards. Dwellings in this category are either almost new or have been recently completely renovated and are similar in condition to new construction.

Note: The improvements represent a relatively new property that is well maintained with no deferred maintenance and little or no physical depreciation, or an older property that has been recently completely renovated.

C3
The improvements are well maintained and feature limited physical depreciation due to normal wear and tear. Some components, but not every major building component, may be updated or recently rehabilitated. The structure has been well maintained.

Note: The improvement is in its first-cycle of replacing short-lived building components (appliances, floor coverings, HVAC, etc.) and is being well maintained. Its estimated effective age is less than its actual age. It also may reflect a property in which the majority of short-lived building components have been replaced but not to the level of a complete renovation.

C4
The improvements feature some minor deferred maintenance and physical deterioration due to normal wear and tear. The dwelling has been adequately maintained and requires only minimal repairs to building components/mechanical systems and cosmetic repairs. All major building components have been adequately maintained and are functionally adequate.

Note: The estimated effective age may be close to or equal to its actual age. It reflects a property in which some of the short-lived building components have been replaced, and some short-lived building components are at or near the end of their physical life expectancy; however, they still function adequately. Most minor repairs have been addressed on an ongoing basis resulting in an adequately maintained property.

C5
The improvements feature obvious deferred maintenance and are in need of some significant repairs. Some building components need repairs, rehabilitation, or updating. The functional utility and overall instability is somewhat diminished due to condition, but the dwelling remains useable and functional as a residence.

Note: Some significant repairs are needed to the improvements due to the lack of adequate maintenance. It reflects a property in which many of its short-lived building components are at the end of or have exceeded their physical life expectancy but remain functional.

C6
The improvements have substantial damage or deferred maintenance with deficiencies or defects that are severe enough to affect the safety, soundness, or structural integrity of the improvements. The improvements are in need of substantial repairs and rehabilitation, including many or most major components.

Note: Substantial repairs are needed to the improvements due to the lack of adequate maintenance or property damage. It reflects a property with conditions severe enough to affect the safety, soundness, or structural integrity of the improvements.

## Quality Ratings and Definitions

Q1
Dwellings with this quality rating are usually unique structures that are individually designed by an architect for a specified user. Such residences typically are constructed from detailed architectural plans and specifications and feature an exceptionally high level of workmanship and exceptionally high-grade materials throughout the interior and exterior of the structure. The design features exceptionally high-quality exterior refinements and ornamentation, and exceptionally high-quality interior refinements. The workmanship, materials, and finishes throughout the dwelling are of exceptionally high quality.

Q2
Dwellings with this quality rating are often custom designed for construction on an individual property owner's site. However, dwellings in this quality grade are also found in high-quality tract developments featuring residence constructed from individual plans or from highly modified or upgraded plans. The design features detailed, high quality exterior ornamentation, high-quality interior refinements, and detail. The workmanship, materials, and finishes throughout the dwelling are generally of high or very high quality.

# UNIFORM APPRAISAL DATASET (UAD) DEFINITIONS ADDENDUM 

(Source: Fannie Mae UAD Appendix D: UAD Fluid-Specific Standardization Requirements)

Quality Ratings and Definitions (continued)

Q3
Dwellings with this quality rating are residences of higher quality built from individual or readily available designer plans in above-standard residential tract developments or on an individual property owner's site. The design includes significant exterior ornamentation and interiors that are well finished. The workmanship exceeds acceptable standards and many materials and finishes throughout the dwelling have been upgraded from "stock" standards.

Q4
Dwellings with this quality rating meet or exceed the requirements of applicable building codes. Standard or modified standard building plans are utilized and the design includes adequate penetration and some exterior ornamentation and interior refinements. Materials, workmanship, finish, and equipment are of stock or builder grade and may feature some upgrades.

Q5
Dwellings with this quality rating feature economy of construction and basic functionality as main considerations. Such dwellings feature a plain design using readily available or basic floor plans featuring minimal fenestration and basic finishes with minimal exterior ornamentation and limited interior detail. These dwellings meet minimum building codes and are constructed with inexpensive, stock materials with limited refinements and upgrades.

Q6
Dwellings with this quality rating are of basic quality and lower cost; some may not be suitable for year-round occupancy. Such dwellings are often built with simple plans or without plans, often utilizing the lowest quality building materials. Such dwellings are often built or expanded by persons who are professionally unskilled or possess only minimal construction skills. Electrical, plumbing, and other mechanical systems and equipment may be minimal or non-existent. Older dwellings may feature one or more substandard or non-conforming additions to the original structure

## Definitions of Not Updated, Updated, and Remodeled

Not Updated
Little or no updating or modernization. This description includes, but is not limited to, new homes.
Residential properties of fifteen years of age or less often reflect an original condition with no updating, if no major components have been replaced or updated. Those over fifteen years of age are also considered not updated if the appliances, fixtures, and finishes are predominantly dated. An area that is "Not Updated" may still be well maintained and fully functional, and this rating does not necessarily imply deferred maintenance or physical/functional deterioration.

Updated
The area of the home has been modified to meet current market expectations. These modifications are limited in terms of both scope and cost.
An updated area of the home should have an improved look and feel, or functional utility. Changes that constitute updates include refurbishment and/or replacing components to meet existing market expectations. Updates do not include significant alterations to the existing structure.

## Remodeled

Significant finish and/or structural changes have been made that increase utility and appeal through complete replacement and/or expansion.
A remodeled area reflects fundamental changes that include multiple alterations. These alterations may include some or all of the following: replacement of a major component (cabinet(s), bathtub, or bathroom file), relocation of plumbing/gas fixtures/appliances, significant structural alterations (relocating walls, and/or the addition of) square footage). This would include a complete getting and rebuild.

Explanation of bathroom Count

Three-quarter baths are counted as a full bath in all cases. Quarter baths (baths that feature only a toilet) are not included in the bathroom count. The number of full and half baths is reported by separating the two valves using a period, where the full bath count is represented to the left of the period and the half bath count is represented to the right of the period.

Example:
3.2 indicates three full baths and two half baths.

# Additional Certifications: 

## DEFINITION OF MARKET VALUE *:

Market value means the most probable price which a property should bring in a competitive and open market under all conditions requisite to a fair sale, the buyer and seller each acting prudently and knowledgeably, and assuming the price is not affected by undue stimulus. Implicit in this definition is the consummation of a sale as of a specified date and the passing of title from seller to buyer under conditions whereby:

1. Buyer and seller are typically motivated;
2. Both parties are well informed or well advised and acting in what they consider their own best interests;
3. A reasonable time is allowed for exposure in the open market;
4. Payment is made in terms of cash in U.S. dollars or in terms of financial arrangements comparable thereto; and
5. The price represents the normal consideration for the property sold unaffected by special or creative financing or sales concessions granted by anyone associated with the sale.

* This definition is from regulations published by federal regulatory agencies pursuant to Title XI of the Financial Institutions Reform, Recovery, and Enforcement Act (FIRREA) of 1989 between July 5, 1990, and August 24, 1990, by the Federal Reserve System (FRS), National Credit Union Administration (NCUA), Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC), the Office of Thrift Supervision (OTS), and the Office of Comptroller of the Currency (OCC). This definition is also referenced in regulations jointly published by the OCC, OTS, FRS, and FDIC on June 7, 1994, and in the Interagency Appraisal and Evaluation Guidelines, dated October 27, 1994.

# Loan Disclosures 

## Assumption

If you sell or transfer this property to another person, your lender
$\square$ will allow, under certain conditions, this person to assume this loan on the original terms.
$\square$ will not allow assumption of this loan on the original terms.

## Demand Feature

Your loan
$\square$ has a demand feature, which permits your lender to require early repayment of the loan. You should review your note for details.
$\square$ does not have a demand feature.

## Late Payment

If your payment is more than 15 days late, your lender will charge a late fee of $5 \%$ of the principal and interest overdue.

Negative Amortization (Increase in Loan Amount)
Under your loan terms, you
$\square$ are scheduled to make monthly payments that do not pay all of the interest due that month. As a result, your loan amount will increase (negatively amortize), and your loan amount will likely become larger than your original loan amount. Increases in your loan amount lower the equity you have in this property.
$\square$ may have monthly payments that do not pay all of the interest due that month. If you do, your loan amount will increase (negatively amortize), and, as a result, your loan amount may become larger than your original loan amount. Increases in your loan amount lower the equity you have in this property.
$\square$ do not have a negative amortization feature.

## Partial Payments

Your lender
$\square$ may accept payments that are less than the full amount due (partial payments) and apply them to your loan.
$\square$ may hold them in a separate account until you pay the rest of the payment, and then apply the full payment to your loan.
$\square$ does not accept any partial payments.
If this loan is sold, your new lender may have a different policy.

## Security Interest

You are granting a security interest in 1009 Lake Drive

Danville, CA 94526

You may lose this property if you do not make your payments or satisfy other obligations for this loan.

## Escrow Account

For now, your loan
$\square$ will have an escrow account (also called an "impound" or "trust" account) to pay the property costs listed below. Without an escrow account, you would pay them directly, possibly in one or two large payments a year. Your lender may be liable for penalties and interest for failing to make a payment.

| Excrow |  |  |
| :--: | :--: | :--: |
| Escrowed Property Costs over Year 1 | $\$ 17,195.09$ | Estimated total amount over year 1 for your escrowed property costs: Property Taxes, Homeowner's Insurance |
| Non-Escrowed Property Costs over Year 1 | $\$ 1,100.00$ | Estimated total amount over year 1 for your non-escrowed property costs: HOA Dues <br> You may have other property costs. |
| Initial Escrow Payment | $\$ 9,379.10$ | A cushion for the escrow account you pay at closing. See Section G on page 2. |
| Monthly Escrow Payment | $\$ 1,563.19$ | The amount included in your total monthly payment. |

$\square$ will not have an escrow account because $\square$ you declined it $\square$ your lender does not offer one. You must directly pay your property costs, such as taxes and homeowner's insurance. Contact your lender to ask if your loan can have an escrow account.

| No Escrow |  |  |

| Estimated <br> Property Costs <br> over Year 1 | Estimated total amount over year 1. You <br> must pay these costs directly, possibly <br> in one or two large payments a year. |  |
| Escrow Walver Fee |  |  |

## In the future,

Your property costs may change and, as a result, your escrow payment may change. You may be able to cancel your escrow account, but if you do, you must pay your property costs directly. If you fail to pay your property taxes, your state or local government may (1) impose fines and penalties or (2) place a tax lien on this property. If you fail to pay any of your property costs, your lender may (1) add the amounts to your loan balance, (2) add an escrow account to your loan, or (3) require you to pay for property insurance that the lender buys on your behalf, which likely would cost more and provide fewer benefits than what you could buy on your own.

$\square$ will have an escrow account (also called an "impound" or "trust" account) to pay the property costs listed below. Without an escrow account, you would pay them directly, possibly in one or two large payments a year. Your lender may be liable for penalties and interest for failing to make a payment.

## In the future,

Your property costs may change and, as a result, your escrow payment may change. You may be able to cancel your escrow account, but if you do, you must pay your property costs directly. If you fail to pay your property taxes, your state or local government may (1) impose fines and penalties or (2) place a tax lien on this property. If you fail to pay any of your property costs, your lender may (1) add the amounts to your loan balance, (2) add an escrow account to your loan, or (3) require you to pay for property insurance that the lender buys on your behalf, which likely would cost more and provide fewer benefits than what you could buy on your own.

## In the future,

Your property costs may change and, as a result, your escrow payment may change. You may be able to cancel your escrow account, but if you do, you must pay your property costs directly. If you fail to pay your property taxes, your state or local government may (1) impose fines and penalties or (2) place a tax lien on this property. If you fail to pay any of your property costs, your lender may (1) add the amounts to your loan balance, (2) add an escrow account to your loan, or (3) require you to pay for property insurance that the lender buys on your behalf, which likely would cost more and provide fewer benefits than what you could buy on your own.

C. On September 23, 2016, Borrower paid a two percent (2\%) loan modification fee based upon the Loan's original amount of $\$ 600,000.00$. This fee was paid as follows: $\$ 6,000.00$ to Rubicon Mortgage Fund LLC, and $\$ 6,000.00$ to Rubicon Realty Advisors, Inc.
D. The Parties agree that the amount of $\$ 600,000.00$ remains due and unpaid under the Loan Documents as of the Effective Date.

2. This Modification only modifies those terms of the Loan Documents as set forth herein.

obligations under any of the Loan Documents, and (ix) there are no subordinate liens of any kind covering or relating to the Real Property, other than as expressly disclosed to Lender, nor are there any mechanics' liens or liens for delinquent taxes or assessments encumbering the Real Property, nor has the notice of a lien or notice of intent to file a lien been received by Borrower. Borrower agrees as a condition of the granting of this Modification to provide Lender with agreements subordinating the rights of any subordinate lienholders to Lender's rights to a priority lien for all sums due under the Loan Documents as modified by this Modification.
6.

Borrower hereby waives the provisions of CCP $\S 1542$, which reads:
"A general release does not extend to claims which the creditor does not know or suspect to exist in his or her favor at the time of executing the release, which if known by him or her must have materially affected his or her settlement with the debtor."
7. Any waiver by Lender of any provision of this Modification shall be in writing and shall be effective only to the extent specifically set forth in such writing and shall have no force and effect on any other provision.

8. Before this Modification becomes effective and any party becomes obligated under it, all of the following conditions shall have been satisfied at Borrower's sole cost and expense in a manner acceptable to Lender or in the exercise of Lender's sole judgment:
a. No event of default shall have occurred under any of the Loan Documents and no event, which with the passage of time, the giving of notice, or both, would .constitute an event of default shall have occurred and be continuing under any of the Loan Documents;
b. This Modification shall have been duly executed, acknowledged and delivered by Borrower.

14.

# EARLY ARM DISCLOSURE STATEMENT 

LendSure Mortgage Corp.
16959 Bernardo Center Drive, Suite 102,
San Diego, CA 92128
PROGRAM NAME: Tier 1 Prime Plus Bank Statement - 7/1 ARM

## IMPORTANT LOAN INFORMATION - PLEASE READ CAREFULLY

You should carefully read this disclosure; the promissory note, deed of trust or mortgage; any riders; and all other documents that you will be asked to sign if you accept an ARM loan.

ADJUSTABLE RATE MORTGAGE MEANS YOUR PAYMENT MAY CHANGE IN THE FUTURE. You are applying for an Adjustable Rate Mortgage (ARM) loan. This means that your interest rate and monthly payments may change during the life of your loan. Your monthly payments will increase if the interest rate rises and decrease if it falls. The date or dates on which changes can occur (referred to in this disclosure as "Change Date") will be specified in the ARM loan documents. This ARM is based on the terms and conditions set forth in this disclosure and in the loan documents. We have based this disclosure on recent interest rates, Index and margin values, discounts, and fees. Ask us for our current interest rate and margin.

An ARM is different from a fixed-rate mortgage loan. For a fixed-rate loan, the monthly payments of principal and interest do not change during the life of the loan. You should consider carefully which type of loan is best for you.

HOW YOUR INTEREST RATE IS DETERMINED. Your interest rate will be determined by means of an index that may change from time to time.

The Index. The interest rate change on this ARM will be based on an interest rate index (referred to in this disclosure as the "Index.") The Index is LIBOR12M. Information about the index is available in the Federal Reserve Statistical Release H-15 (www.federalreserve.gov/releases/h15).

Interest Rate. Your interest rate is based on the Index value plus a margin, rounded to the nearest $\mathbf{0 . 1 2 5}$ percent. A change in the Index generally will result in a change in the interest rate. The amount that your interest rate may change also may be affected by the periodic interest rate change limitations and the lifetime interest rate limits, as discussed below.

Initial Interest Rate Discount. Your initial interest rate will be discounted and will not be based on the Index used to make later adjustments. You should note, however, that because your initial interest rate will be discounted, your interest rate may increase on the first Change Date even if the Index remains the same or decreases. Ask us for the amount of the current interest rate discount.

Interest Rate Adjustments. Your interest rate under this ARM can change after 84 month(s) and every 12 months thereafter. Your interest rate cannot increase or decrease more than $\mathbf{2 . 0 0 0}$ percentage points at first adjustment and 2.000 percentage points per subsequent adjustment from the initial interest rate excluding any buydown. Your interest rate will never be greater than $\mathbf{5 . 0 0 0}$ percentage points above the initial interest rate or lower than $\mathbf{6 . 2 5 0}$.

HOW YOUR PAYMENTS ARE DETERMINED. Your initial monthly payment of principal and interest will be determined based on the interest rate, loan term, and balance when your loan is closed. Your payment will be set to amortize the loan over a period of $\mathbf{3 6 0}$ payments.

Frequency of Payment Changes. Based on increases or decreases in the Index, payment amounts under this ARM loan can change after 84 month(s) and every 12 months thereafter. However, your monthly payment amount could change more frequently if there is a change in the taxes, assessments, insurance premiums, or other charges required to be made into an escrow or impound account.

Limitations on Interest Rate Payment Changes. Your interest rate will not increase or decrease on the first change date by more than $\mathbf{2 . 0 0 0}$ percentage points from the initial interest rate excluding any buydown. After the initial adjustment period, your interest rate will not increase or decrease by more than $\mathbf{2 . 0 0 0}$ percentage points per year. Your interest rate cannot increase more than $\mathbf{5 . 0 0 0}$ percentage points above the initial interest rate (excluding any buydown) over the life of the loan.

Adjustment Notices. You will be notified at least annually if interest rate changes occur. When an interest rate change will also involve a change in your monthly payment, you will be notified in writing (at least 25 calendar days, but not more than 120 calendar days) before the payment at the new level is due. The notice will indicate the adjusted payment amount, interest rate, Index value, and the outstanding loan balance at the time.

HOW YOUR PAYMENT CAN CHANGE ("Worst Case Scenario"). Your payment can change every 12 month(s) based on changes in the loan term, interest rate, or loan balance. For example, on a $\$ 10,000$ loan with a $\mathbf{3 6 0}$ - month term and an initial rate of $\mathbf{6 . 2 5 0}$ (based on a margin of $\mathbf{4 . 0 0 0}$ and index of $\mathbf{1 . 7 7 4}$ rounded to the nearest $\mathbf{0 . 1 2 5 \%}$ ), the maximum amount that the interest rate can rise under this ARM program is $\mathbf{5 . 0 0 0}$ percentage points above the initial interest rate and the payment can rise from a first-year payment of $\mathbf{\$ 6 1 . 5 7}$ to a maximum of $\mathbf{\$ 9 0 . 7 0}$ in the $\mathbf{1 0 t h}$ year.

To see what your payment would be, divide your mortgage amount by $\$ 10,000$, then multiply the monthly payment by that amount. For example, the monthly payment for a new loan amount of $\$ 60,000$ would be $\$ 60,000$ divided by $\$ 10,000=6$. Multiply the payment amount by this number, e.g. $6 \times \$ 61.57=\$ 369.42$

DEMAND FEATURE. This loan does not include a demand feature.
DISCLOSURES FOR OTHER ARM PROGRAMS are available on request.

We will investigate your complaint and will correct any Error promptly.

When reporting the Error: (1) tell us your name and account number (if any); (2) describe the Error (an Error includes an unauthorized electronic funds transfer) or the electronic transfer you are unsure about, and explain as clearly as you can why you believe it is an Error or why you need more information; and (3) tell us the dollar amount of the suspected Error or the transaction you question.

We will investigate your complaint and will correct any Error promptly.

If we ask you to put your complaint or question in writing and we do not receive it within 10 business days, we may not provide provisional credit to your account.

Comerica Check Card Transactions: Notwithstanding the above information, if your account was debited for a transaction resulting from the use of your Comerica Check Card or Check Card number (does not apply to ATM Cards or Visa Check Cards that are not activated), you may have additional rights and protections.

After Oct. 2015, your account statements with the same ownership and address will be combined into one statement for an overall financial review. Accounts with different owners or addresses, will continue to be sent separately.Your statement cycle end date, will now align with your checking account.

# 1. Introduction 

This handbook gives you an overview of adjustable-rate mortgages (ARMs), explains how ARMs work, and discusses some of the issues you might face as a borrower. It includes:

- ways to reduce the risks associated with ARMs;
- pointers about advertising and other sources of information, such as lenders and trusted advisers;
- a glossary of important ARM terms; and
- a worksheet that can help you ask the right questions and figure out whether an ARM is right for you. (Ask lenders to help you fill out the worksheet so you can get the information you need to compare mortgages.)

An ARM is a loan with an interest rate that changes. ARMs may start with lower monthly payments than fixed-rate mortgages, but keep in mind the following:

- Your monthly payments could change. They could go up- sometimes by a lot—even if interest rates don't go up. See page 10.
- Your payments may not go down much, or at all—even if interest rates go down. See page 8.
- You could end up owing more money than you borrowed-even if you make all your payments on time. See page 11 .
- If you want to convert your ARM to a fixed-rate mortgage, you might not be able to. See page 14.

You need to compare the features of ARMs to find the one that best fits your needs. The Mortgage Shopping Worksheet below can help you get started.

# 2. What is an ARM? 

An adjustable-rate mortgage differs from a fixed-rate mortgage in many ways. Most importantly, with a fixed-rate mortgage, the interest rate and the monthly payment of principal and interest stay the same during the life of the loan. With an ARM, the interest rate changes periodically, usually in relation to an index, and payments may go up or down accordingly.

To compare two ARMs, or to compare an ARM with a fixed-rate mortgage, you need to know about indexes, margins, discounts, caps on rates and payments, negative amortization, payment options, and recasting (recalculating) your loan. You need to consider the maximum amount your monthly payment could increase. Most importantly, you need to know what might happen to your monthly mortgage payment in relation to your future ability to afford higher payments.

Lenders generally charge lower initial interest rates for ARMs than for fixed-rate mortgages. At first, this makes the ARM easier on your pocketbook than a fixed-rate mortgage for the same loan amount. Moreover, your ARM could be less expensive over a long period than a fixed-rate mortgage-for example, if interest rates remain steady or move lower.

Against these advantages, you have to weigh the risk that an increase in interest rates would lead to higher monthly payments in the future. It's a trade-off-you get a lower initial rate with an ARM in exchange for assuming more risk over the long run. Here are some questions you need to consider:

- Is my income enough-or likely to rise enough-to cover higher mortgage payments if interest rates go up?

Lenders and brokers: Mortgage loans are offered by many kinds of lenders-such as banks, mortgage companies, and credit unions. You can also get a loan through a mortgage broker. Brokers "arrange" loans; in other words, they find a lender for you. Brokers generally take your application and contact several lenders, but keep in mind that brokers are not required to find the best deal for you unless they have contracted with you to act as your agent, or have a duty to do so under state law.

- Will I be taking on other sizable debts, such as a loan for a car or school tuition, in the near future?
- How long do I plan to own this home? If you plan to sell soon, rising interest rates may not pose the problem they might if you plan to own the house for a long time.
- Do I plan to make any additional payments or pay the loan off early?


## 3. How ARMs work: the basic features

### 3.1 Initial rate and payment

The initial rate and payment amount on an ARM will remain in effect for a limited period-ranging from just one month to five years or more. For some ARMs, the initial rate and payment can vary greatly from the rates and payments later in the loan term. Even if interest rates are stable, your rates and payments could change a lot. If lenders or brokers quote the initial rate and payment on a loan, ask them for the annual percentage rate (APR). If the APR is significantly higher than the initial rate, then it is likely that your rate and payments will be a lot higher when the loan adjusts, even if general interest rates remain the same.

### 3.2 The adjustment period

Depending on the type of ARM loan, the interest rate and monthly payment will change every month, quarter, year, three years, or five years. The period between rate changes is called the adjustment period. For example, a loan with an adjustment period of one year is called a one-year ARM, because the interest rate and payment change once every year; a loan with a three-year adjustment period is called a three-year ARM.

# LOAN \#: CAS09175551609 

If you take out an adjustable-rate mortgage, the company that collects your mortgage payments (your servicer) must notify you about the first interest rate adjustment at least seven months before you owe a payment at the adjusted interest rate. The advance notification needs to show:

- An estimate of the new interest rate and payment amount
- Alternatives available to you
- How to contact a HUD-approved housing counselor

For the first interest rate adjustment, as well as for any adjustments that come later that give you a different payment amount, your servicer must also send you another notice, at least 60 days in advance, telling you what your new payment will be.

### 3.3 The index

The interest rate on an ARM is made up of two parts: the index and the margin. The index is a measure of interest rates generally, and the margin is an extra amount that the lender adds above the index. Your payments will be affected by any caps, or limits, on how high or low your rate can go. If the index rate moves up, your interest rate will also go up in most circumstances, and you will probably have to make higher monthly payments. On the other hand, if the index rate goes down, your monthly payment could go down. Not all ARMs adjust downward, however-be sure to read the information for the loan you are considering.

Lenders base ARM rates on a variety of indexes. Among the most common indexes are the rates on one-year constantmaturity Treasury (CMT) securities, the Cost of Funds Index (COFI), and the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR). A few lenders use their own cost of funds as an index, rather than using other indexes. You should ask what index will be used, how it has fluctuated in the past, and where it is published-you can find a lot of this information in major newspapers and on the Internet.

To help you get an idea of how to compare different indexes, the following chart shows a few common indexes over an 11-year period (2003-2013). As you can see, some index rates tend to be higher than others, and some change more often than others.

# 3.4 The margin 

To set the interest rate on an ARM, lenders add a few percentage points to the index rate, called the margin. The amount of the margin may differ from one lender to another, but it usually stays the same over the life of the loan. The fully indexed rate is equal to the margin plus the index. For example, if the lender uses an index that currently is 4 percent and adds a 3 percent margin, the fully indexed rate would be

| Index | $4 \%$ |
| :-- | :-- |
| Margin | $3 \%$ |
| Fully indexed rate | $7 \%$ |

If the index on this loan rose to 5 percent, the fully indexed rate at the next adjustment would be 8 percent ( 5 percent + 3 percent). If the index fell to 2 percent, the fully indexed rate at adjustment would be 5 percent ( 2 percent +3 percent).

Some lenders base the amount of the margin on your credit record- the better your credit, the lower the margin they add-and the lower the interest you will have to pay on your mortgage. The amount of the margin could also be based on other factors. In comparing ARMs, look at both the index and margin for each program.

If the initial rate on the loan is less than the fully indexed rate, it is called a discounted (or "teaser") index rate. Many ARM loans offer a discounted index rate until the first adjustment period, but some ARM loans have an initial rate that is higher than the fully indexed rate.

Ability to repay: When you apply for a loan, lenders are generally required to collect and verify enough of your financial information to determine you have the ability to repay the loan. For example, a lender might ask to see copies of your most recent pay stubs, income tax filings, and bank account statements. Lenders are generally required to consider your ability to repay the loan based on the fully indexed rate, or the highest rate you will be expected to pay in the first five years of the loan.

### 3.5 Interest-rate caps

An interest-rate cap places a limit on the amount your interest rate can increase. Interest-rate caps come in two versions:

- A periodic adjustment cap, which limits the amount the interest rate can adjust up or down from one adjustment period to the next after the first adjustment, and
- A lifetime cap, which limits the interest-rate increase over the life of the loan. By law, virtually all ARMs must have a lifetime cap.


### 3.5.1 Periodic adjustment caps

Let's suppose you have an ARM with a periodic adjustment interest-rate cap of 2 percent. However, at the first adjustment, the index rate has risen 3 percent. The following example shows what happens.

Examples in this handbook: All examples in this handbook are based on a $\$ 200,000$ loan amount and a 30-year term. Payment amounts in the examples do not include taxes, insurance, condominium or homeowner association fees, or similar items. These amounts can be a significant part of your monthly payment.

LOAN \#: CASDW175551609
1st year's monthly payment at $6 \%$

2nd year's monthly payment at $9 \%$ (without cap)
2nd year's monthly payment at $8 \%$ (with cap)
![img-121.jpeg](img-121.jpeg)

Difference in 2nd year between payment with cap and payment without $=\$ 138.70$ per month

In this example, because of the cap on your loan, your monthly payment in year two is $\$ 138.70$ per month lower than it would be without the cap, saving you $\$ 1,664.40$ over the year.

Some ARMs allow a larger rate change at the first adjustment and then apply a periodic adjustment cap to all future adjustments.

A drop in interest rates does not always lead to a drop in your monthly payments. With some ARMs that have interest-rate caps, the cap may hold your rate and payment below what it would have been if the change in the index rate had been fully applied. The increase in the interest that was not imposed because of the rate cap might carry over to future rate adjustments. This is called carryover. So, at the next adjustment date, your payment might increase even though the index rate has stayed the same or declined.

The following example shows how carryovers work. Suppose the index on your ARM increased 3 percent during the first year.

Because this ARM loan limits rate increases to 2 percent at any one time, the rate is adjusted by only 2 percent, to 8 percent for the second year. However, the remaining 1 percent increase in the index carries over to the next time the lender can adjust rates. So, when the lender adjusts the interest rate for the third year, even if there has been no change in the index during the second year, the rate still increases by 1 percent, to 9 percent.

1st year at $6 \%$
If index rises $3 \%$, to $9 \%, 2$ nd year with $2 \%$ rate cap at $8 \%$
If index stays the same for the 3rd year, at $9 \%$
![img-122.jpeg](img-122.jpeg)

In general, the rate on your loan can go up at any scheduled adjustment date when the lender's standard ARM rate (the index plus the margin) is higher than the rate you are paying before that adjustment.

# 3.5.2 Lifetime caps 

The next example shows how a lifetime rate cap would affect your loan. Let's say that your ARM starts out with a 6 percent rate and the loan has a 6 percent lifetime cap-that is, the rate can never exceed 12 percent. Suppose the index rate increases 1 percent in each of the next nine years. With a 6 percent overall cap, your payment would never exceed $\$ 1,998.84$ —compared with the $\$ 2,409.11$ that it would have reached in the tenth year without a cap.
![img-123.jpeg](img-123.jpeg)

### 3.6 Payment caps

In addition to interest-rate caps, many ARMs-including payment-option ARMs (discussed on page 11)—limit, or cap, the amount your monthly payment may increase at the time of each adjustment. For example, if your loan has a payment cap of $71 / 2$ percent, your monthly payment won't increase more than $71 / 2$ percent over your previous payment, even if interest rates rise more. For example, if your monthly payment in year 1 of your mortgage was $\$ 1,000$, it could only go up to $\$ 1,075$ in year $2(71 / 2$ percent of $\$ 1,000$ is an additional $\$ 75)$. Any interest you don't pay because of the payment cap will be added to the balance of your loan. A payment cap can limit the increase to your monthly payments but also can add to the amount you owe on the loan. This is called negative amortization, a term explained on page 13 .

Let's assume that your rate changes in the first year by two percentage points, but your payments can increase no more than $71 / 2$ percent in any one year. The following graph shows what your monthly payments would look like.
![img-124.jpeg](img-124.jpeg)

Difference in monthly payment $=\$ 172.69$

While your monthly payment will be only $\$ 1,289.03$ for the second year, the difference of $\$ 172.69$ each month will be added to the balance of your loan and will lead to negative amortization.

Some ARMs with payment caps do not have periodic interest-rate caps. In addition, as explained below, most paymentoption ARMs have a built-in recalculation period, usually every five years. At that point, your payment will be recalculated

# LOAN \#: CAGDW175551609 

(lenders use the term recast) based on the remaining term of the loan. If you have a 30-year loan and you are at the end of year five, your payment will be recalculated for the remaining 25 years. The payment cap does not apply to this adjustment. If your loan balance has increased, or if interest rates have risen faster than your payments, your payments could go up a lot.

## 4. Types of ARMs

### 4.1 Hybrid ARMs

Hybrid ARMs often are advertised as $3 / 1$ or $5 / 1$ ARMs-you might also see ads for $7 / 1$ or 10/1 ARMs. These loans are a mix- or a hybrid-of a fixed-rate period and an adjustable-rate period. The interest rate is fixed for the first few years of these loans-for example, for five years in a $5 / 1$ ARM. After that, the rate may adjust annually (the 1 in the $5 / 1$ example), until the loan is paid off. In the case of $3 / 1,5 / 1,7 / 1$ or $10 / 1$ ARMs:

- the first number tells you how long the fixed interest-rate period will be, and
- the second number tells you how often the rate will adjust after the initial period.

You may also see ads for $2 / 28$ or $3 / 27$ ARMs-the first number tells you how many years the fixed interest-rate period will be, and the second number tells you the number of years the rates on the loan will be adjustable. Some $2 / 28$ and $3 / 27$ mortgages adjust every six months, not annually.

### 4.2 Interest-only ARMs

An interest-only (I-O) ARM payment plan allows you to pay only the interest for a specified number of years, typically for three to 10 years. This allows you to have smaller monthly payments for a period. After that, your monthly payment will increase-even if interest rates stay the same-because you must start paying back the principal as well as the interest each month.

For some I-O loans, the interest rate adjusts during the I-O period as well.
For example, if you take out a 30-year mortgage loan with a five-year I-O payment period, you can pay only interest for five years and then you must pay both the principal and interest over the next 25 years. Because you begin to pay back the principal, your payments increase after year five, even if the rate stays the same. Keep in mind that the longer the I-O period, the higher your monthly payments will be after the I-O period ends.
![img-125.jpeg](img-125.jpeg)

# 4.3 Payment-option ARMs 

A payment-option ARM is an adjustable-rate mortgage that allows you to choose among several payment options each month. The options typically include the following:

- A traditional payment of principal and interest, which reduces the amount you owe on your mortgage. These payments are based on a set loan term, such as a 15-, 30-, or 40-year payment schedule.
- An interest-only payment, which pays the interest but does not reduce the amount you owe on your mortgage as you make your payments.
- A minimum (or limited) payment, which may be less than the amount of interest due that month and may not reduce the amount you owe on your mortgage. If you choose this option, the amount of any interest you do not pay will be added to the principal of the loan, increasing the amount you owe and your future monthly payments, and increasing the amount of interest you will pay over the life of the loan. In addition, if you pay only the minimum payment in the last few years of the loan, you may owe a larger payment at the end of the loan term, called a balloon payment.

In addition to these options, in most cases you can choose to pay any amount over the required minimum payment.
The interest rate on a payment-option ARM is typically very low for the first few months (for example, 2 percent for the first one to three months). After that, the interest rate usually rises to a rate closer to that of other mortgage loans. Your payments during the first year are based on the initial low rate, meaning that if you only make the minimum payment each month, it will not reduce the amount you owe and it may not cover the interest due. The unpaid interest is added to the amount you owe on the mortgage, and your loan balance increases. This is called negative amortization. This means that even after making many payments, you could owe more than you did at the beginning of the loan. See a further caution about negative amortization in the "Consumer Cautions" section below. Also, as interest rates go up, your payments are likely to go up.

Payment-option ARMs have a built-in recalculation period, usually every five years. At this point, your payment will be recalculated (or "recast") based on the remaining term of the loan. If you have a 30-year loan and you are at the end of year five, your payment will be recalculated for the remaining 25 years. If your loan balance has increased because you have made only minimum payments, or if interest rates have risen faster than your payments, your payments will increase each time your loan is recast. At each recast, your new minimum payment will be a fully amortizing payment and any payment cap will not apply. This means that your monthly payment can increase a lot at each recast.

Lenders may recalculate your loan payments before the recast period if the amount of principal you owe grows beyond a set limit, say 110 percent or 125 percent of your original mortgage amount. For example, suppose you made only minimum payments on your $\$ 200,000$ mortgage and had any unpaid interest added to your balance. If the balance grew to $\$ 250,000$ ( 125 percent of $\$ 200,000$ ), your lender would recalculate your payments so that you would pay off the loan over the remaining term. It is likely that your payments would go up substantially.

More information on interest-only and payment-option ARMs is available in a Federal Reserve Board brochure, InterestOnly Mortgage Payments and Payment-Option ARMs-Are They for You?
(available online at fdic.gov/consumers/consumer/interest-only).

## 5. Consumer cautions

### 5.1 Discounted interest rates

Many lenders offer more than one type of ARM. Some lenders offer an ARM with an initial rate that is lower than their fully indexed ARM rate (that is, lower than the sum of the index plus the margin). Such rates-called discounted rates, start rates, or teaser rates-are often combined with large initial loan fees, sometimes called points, and with higher rates after the initial discounted rate expires.

# LOAN \#: CAGDW175551609 

Your lender or broker may offer you a choice of loans that may include "discount points" or a "discount fee." You may choose to pay these points or fees in return for a lower interest rate. But keep in mind that the lower interest rate may only last until the first adjustment.

If a lender offers you a loan with a discount rate, don't assume that means the loan is a good one for you. You should carefully consider whether you will be able to afford higher payments in later years when the discount expires and the rate is adjusted.

Here is an example of how a discounted initial rate might work. Let's assume that the lender's fully indexed 1-year ARM rate (index rate plus margin) is currently 6 percent; the monthly payment for the first year would be $\$ 1,199.10$. But your lender is offering an ARM with a discounted initial rate of 4 percent for the first year. With the 4 percent rate, your first-year's monthly payment would be $\$ 954.83$.

With a discounted ARM, your initial payment will probably remain at $\$ 954.83$ for only a limited time-and any savings during the discount period may be offset by higher payments over the remaining life of the mortgage. If you are considering a discount ARM, be sure to compare future payments with those for a fully indexed ARM. Lenders are generally required to consider your ability to repay the loan based on the fully indexed rate, or the highest rate you will be expected to pay in the first five years of the loan. Even so, if you buy a home or refinance using a deeply discounted initial rate, you run the risk of payment shock, negative amortization, or conversion fees. You should always look at your own budget to see how high of a payment and how big of a home loan you feel you can afford.

Another way you may get a discounted interest rate is through a "buydown." This is when the house seller pays an amount to the lender so the lender can give you a lower rate and lower payments, usually for an initial period in an ARM. The seller may increase the sales price to cover the cost of the buydown.

### 5.2 Payment shock

Payment shock may occur if your mortgage payment rises sharply at a rate adjustment. Let's see what would happen in the second year if the rate on your discounted 4 percent ARM were to rise to the 6 percent fully indexed rate.
![img-126.jpeg](img-126.jpeg)

As the example shows, even if the index rate were to stay the same, your monthly payment would go up from $\$ 954.83$ to $\$ 1,192.63$ in the second year.

Suppose that the index rate increases 1 percent in one year and the ARM rate rises to 7 percent. Your payment in the second year would be $\$ 1,320.59$.

That's an increase of $\$ 365.76$ in your monthly payment. You can see what might happen if you choose an ARM because of a low initial rate. While your lender generally needs to consider this indexed rate in determining your ability to repay the loan, you also need to consider whether you will be able to afford future payments.

If you have an interest-only ARM, payment shock can also occur when the interest-only period ends. Or, if you have a payment-option ARM, payment shock can happen when the loan is recast.

The following example compares several different loans over the first seven years of their terms; the payments shown are for years one, six, and seven of the mortgage, assuming you make interest-only payments or minimum payments. The main point is that, depending on the terms and conditions of your mortgage and changes in interest rates, ARM payments can change quite a bit over the life of the loan-so while you could save money in the first few years of an ARM, you could also face much higher payments in the future.
![img-127.jpeg](img-127.jpeg)

# 5.3 Negative amortization 

Negative amortization means that the amount you owe increases even when you make all your required payments on time. It occurs whenever your monthly mortgage payments are not large enough to pay all of the interest due on your mort-gage-meaning the unpaid interest is added to the principal on your mortgage and you will owe more than you originally borrowed. This can happen because you are making only minimum payments on a payment-option mortgage or because your loan has a payment cap.

For example, suppose you have a $\$ 200,000,30$-year payment-option ARM with a 2 percent rate for the first three months and a 6 percent rate for the remaining nine months of the year. Your minimum payment for the year is $\$ 739.24$, as shown in the previous graph. However, once the 6 percent rate is applied to your loan balance, you are no longer covering the interest costs. If you continue to make minimum payments on this loan, your loan balance at the end of the first year of your mortgage would be $\$ 201,118$-or $\$ 1,118$ more than you originally borrowed.

Because payment caps limit only the amount of payment increases, and not interest-rate increases, payments sometimes do not cover all the interest due on your loan. This means that the unpaid interest is automatically added to your debt, and interest may be charged on that amount. You might owe more later in the loan term than you did at the beginning.

A payment cap limits the increase in your monthly payment by deferring some of the interest. Eventually, you would have to repay the higher remaining loan balance at the interest rate then in effect. When this happens, there may be a substantial increase in your monthly payment.

Some mortgages include a cap on negative amortization. The cap typically limits the total amount you can

Home prices, home equity, and ARMs: Sometimes home prices rise rapidly, allowing people to quickly build equity in their homes. This can make some people think that even if the rate and payments on their ARM get too high, they can avoid those higher payments by refinancing their loan or, in the worst case, selling their home. It's important to remember that home prices do not always go up quickly-they may increase a little or remain the same, and sometimes they fall. If housing prices fall, your home may not be worth as much as you owe on the mortgage. Also, you may find it difficult to refinance your loan to get a lower monthly payment or rate. Even if home prices stay the same, if your loan lets you make minimum payments (see payment-option ARMs above), you may owe your lender more on your mortgage than you could get from selling your home.

# LOAN \#: CAGDW175551609 

owe to 110 percent to 125 percent of the original loan amount. When you reach that point, the lender will set the monthly payment amounts to fully repay the loan over the remaining term. Your payment cap will not apply, and your payments could be substantially higher. You may limit negative amortization by voluntarily increasing your monthly payment.

Be sure you know whether the ARM you are considering can have negative amortization. If so, and if you are a first-time borrower, your lender is required to make sure you get homeownership counseling before the lender can lend you the money.

### 5.4 Prepayment penalties and conversion

If you get an ARM, you may decide later that you don't want to risk any increases in the interest rate and payment amount. When you are considering an ARM, ask whether you would be able to convert your ARM to a fixed-rate mortgage.

### 5.4.1 Prepayment penalties

Some mortgage loans can require you to pay special fees or penalties if you refinance or pay off the loan early (usually within the first three years of the loan). These are called prepayment penalties, and they are not allowed on ARMs.

### 5.4.2 Conversion fees

Your agreement with the lender may include a clause that lets you convert the ARM to a fixed-rate mortgage at designated times. When you convert, the new rate is generally set using a formula given in your loan documents.

The interest rate or up-front fees may be somewhat higher for a convertible ARM. Also, a convertible ARM may require a fee at the time of conversion.

### 5.5 Graduated-payment or stepped-rate loans

Some fixed-rate loans start with one rate for one or two years and then change to another rate for the remaining term of the loan. While these are not ARMs, your payment will go up according to the terms of your contract. Talk with your lender or broker and read the information provided to you to make sure you understand when and by how much the payment will change.

## 6. Where to get information

### 6.1 Disclosures from lenders

You should receive information in writing about each ARM program you are interested in before you have paid a nonrefundable fee. It is important that you read this information and ask the lender or broker about anything you don't understand-index rates, margins, caps, and other features such as negative amortization. After you have applied for a loan, you will get more information from the lender about your loan, including the annual percentage rate (APR) and a rate and payment summary table.

The APR is the cost of your credit as a yearly rate. It takes into account interest, points paid on the loan, any fees paid to the lender for making the loan, and any mortgage insurance premiums you may have to pay. You can compare APRs on similar ARMs (for example, compare APRs on a $5 / 1$ and a $3 / 1$ ARM) to determine which loan will cost you less in the long term, but you should keep in mind that because the interest rate for an ARM can change, APRs on ARMs cannot be compared directly to APRs for fixed-rate mortgages.

You may want to talk with financial advisers, housing counselors, and other trusted advisers. The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) supports housing counseling agencies throughout the country that can provide

# LOAN \#: CASDW175551609 

free or low-cost advice. You can search for HUD-approved housing counseling agencies in your area on the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau's website at consumerfinance.gov/find-a-housing-counselor or by calling HUD's interactive toll-free number at 800-569-4287.

Also, see the More information and Contact information appendices below for more information available from the CFPB and a list of other federal agencies that can provide more information and assistance.

### 6.2 Newspapers and the Internet

When buying a home or refinancing your existing mortgage, remember to shop around. Compare costs and terms, and negotiate for the best deal. Your local newspaper and the Internet are good places to start shopping for a loan. You can usually find information on interest rates and points for several lenders. Since rates and points can change daily, you'll want to check information sources often when shopping for a home loan.

The Mortgage Shopping Worksheet at the beginning of this booklet may also help you. Take it with you when you speak to each lender or broker, and write down the information you obtain. Don't be afraid to make lenders and brokers compete with each other for your business by letting them know that you are shopping for the best deal.

### 6.3 Advertisements

Any initial information you receive about mortgages probably will come from advertisements or mail solicitations from builders, real estate brokers, mortgage brokers, and lenders. Although this information can be helpful, keep in mind that these are marketing materials-the ads and mailings are designed to make the mortgage look as attractive as possible. These ads may play up low initial interest rates and monthly payments, without emphasizing that those rates and payments could increase substantially later. So, get all the facts.

Any ad for an ARM that shows an initial interest rate should also show how long the rate is in effect and the APR on the loan. If the APR is much higher than the initial rate, your payments may increase a lot after the introductory period, even if interest rates stay the same.

Choosing a mortgage may be the most important financial decision you will make. You are entitled to have all the information you need to make the right decision. Don't hesitate to ask questions about ARM features when you talk to lenders, mortgage brokers, real estate agents, sellers, and your attorney, and keep asking until you get clear and complete answers.

# Defined terms 

This glossary provides general definitions for terms commonly used in the real estate market. They may have different legal meanings depending on the context.

## DEFINED TERM

ADJUSTABLE-RATE MORTGAGE (ARM)

## ANNUAL PERCENTAGE RATE (APR)

A mortgage that does not have a fixed interest rate. The rate changes during the life of the loan based on movements in an index rate, such as the rate for Treasury securities or the Cost of Funds Index. ARMs usually offer a lower initial interest rate than fixed-rate loans. The interest rate fluctuates over the life of the loan based on market conditions, but the loan agreement generally sets maximum and minimum rates. When interest rates increase, generally your loan payments increase; and when interest rates decrease, your monthly payments may decrease.

The cost of credit expressed as a yearly rate. For closed-end credit, such as car loans or mortgages, the APR includes the interest rate, points, broker fees, and other credit charges that the borrower is required to pay. An APR, or an equivalent rate, is not used in leasing agreements.

A large extra payment that may be charged at the end of a mortgage loan or lease.

When the seller pays an amount to the lender so that the lender can give you a lower rate and lower payments, usually for an initial period in an ARM. The seller may increase the sales price to cover the cost of the buydown. Buydowns can occur in all types of mortgages, not just ARMs.

A limit on the amount that your interest rate can increase. The two types of interest rate caps are periodic adjustment caps and life- time caps. Periodic adjustment caps limit the interest-rate increase from one adjustment period to the next. Lifetime caps limit the interest-rate increase over the life of the loan. All adjustable-rate mortgages have an overall cap.

A limit on the amount that your monthly mortgage payment on a loan may change, usually a percentage of the loan. The limit can be applied each time the payment changes or during the life of the mortgage. Payment caps may lead to negative amortization because they do not limit the amount of interest the lender is earning.

A provision in some ARMs that allows you to change the ARM to a fixed-rate loan at some point during the term. Conversion is usually allowed at the end of the first adjustment period. At the time of the conversion, the new fixed rate is generally set at one of the rates then prevailing for fixed-rate mortgages. The conversion feature may be available at extra cost.

| DISCOUNTED INITIAL RATE (ALSO KNOWN AS A START RATE OR TEASER RATE) | In an ARM with a discounted initial rate, the lender offers you a lower rate and lower payments for part of the mortgage term (usually for 1, 3, or 5 years). After the discount period, the ARM rate will probably go up depending on the index rate. Discounts can occur in all types of mortgages, not just ARMs. |
| --- | --- |
| EQUITY | In housing markets, equity is the difference between the fair market value of the home and the outstanding balance on your mortgage plus any outstanding home equity loans. |
| HYBRID ARM | These ARMs are a mix-or a hybrid-of a fixed-rate period and an adjustable-rate period. The interest rate is fixed for the first several years of the loan; after that period, the rate can adjust annually. For example, hybrid ARMs can be advertised as 3/1 or 5/1-the first number tells you how long the fixed interest-rate period will be and the second number tells you how often the rate will adjust after the initial period. For example, a 3/1 loan has a fixed rate for the first 3 years and then the rate adjusts once each year beginning in year 4. |
| INDEX | The economic indicator used to calculate interest-rate adjustments for adjustable-rate mortgages or other adjustable-rate loans. The index rate can increase or decrease at any time. See also the chart on page 6, Selected index rates for ARMs over an 11-year period, for examples of common indexes that have changed in the past. |
| INTEREST | The rate used to determine the cost of borrowing money, usually stated as a percentage and as an annual rate. |
| INTEREST-ONLY (I-O) ARM | Interest-only ARMs allow you to pay only the interest for a specified number of years, typically between three and 10 years. This arrangement allows you to have smaller monthly payments for a prescribed period. After that period, your monthly payment will increase—even if interest rates stay the same—because you must start paying back the principal and the interest each month. For some I-O loans, the interest rate adjusts during the I-O period as well. |
| MARGIN | The number of percentage points the lender adds to the index rate to calculate the interest rate of an adjustable-rate mortgage (ARM) at each adjustment. |
| NEGATIVE AMORTIZATION | Occurs when the monthly payments in an adjustable-rate mortgage loan do not cover all the interest owed. The interest that is not paid in the monthly payment is added to the loan balance. This means that even after making many payments, you could owe more than you did at the beginning of the loan. Negative amortization can occur when an ARM has a payment cap that results in monthly payments that are not high enough to cover the interest due or when the minimum payments are set at an amount lower than the amount you owe in interest. |
| PAYMENT-OPTION ARM | An ARM that allows the borrower to choose among several payment options each month. The options typically include (1) a traditional amortizing payment of principal and interest, (2) an interest-only payment, or (3) a minimum (or limited) payment that may be less than the amount of interest due that month. If the borrower chooses the minimum-payment option, the amount of any interest that is not paid will be added to the principal of the loan. See also the definition of negative amortization, above. |

| POINTS (ALSO CALLED DISCOUNT POINTS) | The amount of money borrowed or the amount still owed on a loan. |

## Re: LOE on Child Support

This LOE is written in response to questions regarding the former Child Support obligation of Augustine Lopez.

On December 10, 2004, Augustine was divorced in Contra Costa County, California and a Judgment of Dissolution of Marriage was entered.

In September 2005, Augustine moved to Michigan and the post-Judgment portion of the case (Custody and Child Support) was transferred to Michigan, where Augustine , Mathilda , and Augustine's 3 kids from the prior marriage lived. In September 2007, Augustine and Mathilda moved back to California but the 3 kids and their mother remained in Michigan. In January 2009, Augustine's middle child, Susan, moved to California to live with Augustine and Mathilda

On February 9, 2014, Augustine and his ex-wife Angela Snowden signed court orders that there were no child support arrears and Augustine would not be liable for any future child support obligations. [See attachment]

Sincerely,
Augustine M Lopes, Esq.

![img-128.jpeg](img-128.jpeg)

This order is entered $\square$ after hearing. $\square$ after statutory review. $\square$ on stipulation/consent of the parties.
The friend of the court recommends support be ordered as follows.

8. Address, Employment Status, Health Insurance. Both parties shall notify the friend of the court in writing of: a) their mailing and residential addresses and telephone numbers; b) the names, addresses, and telephone numbers of their sources of income; c) their health-maintenance or insurance companies, insurance coverage, persons insured, or contract numbers; d) their occupational or drivers' licenses; and e) their social security numbers unless exempt by law pursuant to MCL 552.603. Both parties shall notify the friend of the court in writing within 21 days of any change in this information. Failure to do so may result in a fee being imposed.
9. Foster-Care Assignment. When a child is placed in foster care, that child's support is assigned to the Department of Human Services while under the state's jurisdiction and to the funding county while placed in a county-funded program.
10. Redirection and Abatement. Subject to statutory procedures, the friend of the court : 1) may redirect support paid for a child to the person who is legally responsible for that child, or 2) shall abate support charges for a child who resides on a full-time basis with the payer of support.
11. Fees. The payer of support shall pay statutory and service fees as required by law.
12. Review. Each party to a support order may submit a written request to have the friend of the court review the order. The friend of the court is not required to act on more than one request received from a party each 36 months. A party may also file a motion to modify this support order.
(See page 3 for the remainder of the order.)

![img-130.jpeg](img-130.jpeg)
13. Prior Orders. This order supersedes all prior child-support orders and all continuing provisions are restated in this order. Past-due amounts owed under any prior support order are preserved and paid at the rate calculated using the arrearage guideline in the Michigan Child Support Formula.
14. Deviation. The support provisions ordered $\checkmark$ do do not follow the child-support formula. (If there is a deviation, state the amount and reasons for deviation in item 15.)

# 15. Other: (Attach separate sheets as needed.) 

That any arrearage in child support that is allegedly owed by Defendant father to Plaintiff mother as of the date of entry of the attached Stipulated Order Terminating Arrears is canceled in its entirety.

## NOTICE

Dissolution or legal separation may automatically cancel the rights of a spouse under the other spouse's wills trust, retirement benefit plan, power of attorney, pay-on-death bank account, transfer-on-death vehicle registration, survivorship rights to any property owned in joint tenancy, and any other similar thing. It does not automatically cancel the rights of a spouse as beneficiary of the other spouse's life insurance policy. You should review these matters, as well as any credit cards, other credit accounts, insurance policies, retirement benefit plans, and credit reports, to determine whether they should be changed or whether you should take any other actions.
A debt or obligation may be assigned to one party as part of the dissolution of property and debts, but if that party does not pay the debt or obligation, the creditor may be able to collect from the other party.
An earnings assignment will automatically be issued if child support, family support, or spousal support is ordered.
Any party required to pay support must pay interest on overdue amounts at the "legal rate," which is currently 10 percent.

If You have a Policy for the Real Estate Transaction with an Amount of Insurance greater than $\$ 2,000,000$, a claim arising under this letter may be submitted to arbitration only when agreed to by both the Company and You. If the Real Estate Transaction solely involves a one-to-four family residence and You are the purchaser or borrower, the Company will pay the costs of arbitration.

This closing protection letter supersedes and cancels any previous letter or similar agreement for closing protection that applies to the Real Estate Transaction.

# REVIEW APPRAISER'S SCOPE OF WORK, LIMITING CONDITIONS, AND CERTIFICATION 

INTENDED USE: The intended use of this appraisal desk review is to assist the client in determining possible appraisal deficiencies. This review should not be used for loan financing purposes.

INTENDED USERS: The intended user of this appraisal desk review is the lender/client.
DEFINITION OF MARKET VALUE: The most probable price which a property should bring in a competitive and open market under all conditions requisite to a fair sale, the buyer and seller, each acting prudently, knowledgeably and assuming the price is not affected by undue stimulus. Implicit in this definition is the consummation of a sale as of a specified date and the passing of title from seller to buyer under conditions whereby: (1) buyer and seller are typically motivated; (2) both parties are well informed or well advised, and each acting in what he or she considers his or her own best interest; (3) a reasonable time is allowed for exposure in the open market; (4) payment is made in terms of cash in U.S. dollars or in terms of financial arrangements comparable thereto; and (5) the price represents the normal consideration for the property sold unaffected by special or creative financing or sales concessions* granted by anyone associated with the sale.
*Adjustments to the comparables must be made for special or creative financing or sales concessions. No adjustments are necessary for those costs which are normally paid by sellers as a result of tradition or law in a market area; these costs are readily identifiable since the seller pays these costs in virtually all sales transactions. Special or creative financing adjustments can be made to the comparable property by comparisons to financing terms offered by a third party institutional lender that is not already involved with the property or transaction. Any adjustment should not be calculated on a mechanical dollar for dollar cost of the financing or concession but the dollar amount of any adjustment should approximate the market's reaction to the financing or concessions based on the appraiser's judgment.

SCOPE OF WORK: My scope of work included the review of appraisal reports and other documents. This appraisal review is intended to comply with Standards Rule 3 of the Uniform Standards of Professional Appraisal Practice (USPAP). Appraisal reports under review, real estate and real property interests appraised, date of reports and effective dates of value estimates, date of review, identity of appraisers, and identity of the internal reviewer are all contained within the internal review report. All known pertinent information was included. The purpose of this review was to assess the reasonableness of the value estimate(s) and determine compliance with USPAP. Appraisal reports subject to review have been read and analyzed to form an opinion as to:
I. Completeness of the report under review within the scope of work applicable in the review assignment;
a. Apparent adequacy, relevance, and appropriateness of data and adjustments; and,
b. Whether the analyses, methods, opinions, and conclusions in the reports under review are appropriate and reasonable. Reasons for any disagreement are contained within this review report.
c. Additional Valuation Reports such as BPDs (Broker Price Opinions), AVMs and various additional valuation products could be included in this review and analysis.

If the scope of this internal appraisal review includes an independent value conclusion, it is developed and reported in compliance with USPAP, SR 3. The purpose of such an internal review appraisal is to estimate market value of the fee simple interest in the subject, and intended to assist the underwriter in determining possible appraisal deficiencies. Service 1st Valuation and Settlement Services Inc. and its direct client is the only intended user. I have extended, by way of Extraordinary Assumption, those portions of the original appraisal that are considered credible and developed in compliance with USPAP Standard I. Portions of the reviewed reports that are not considered credible and developed in compliance with USPAP Standard I are described in this internal appraisal review report. Supplemental review information may include but is not limited to information from public records, multiple listing services, national vendors, real estate professionals, referenced appraiser(s) and/or peers, file information, and cost estimating resources. The scope of analysis may include reconsideration and reconciliation of value indications from the cost, sales comparison, and income approaches to value for the subject real property. Personal property values are excluded.

EXTRAORDINARY ASSUMPTIONS AND HYPOTHETICAL CONDITIONS: This review appraisal is based on the extraordinary assumption that the original appraisal report contained accurate location, condition and physical characteristic information on the subject property from an exterior and interior observation (if interior observation is applicable), and the comparable properties based on exterior observation. The review appraiser did not perform a physical observation of the exterior or the interior of the subject property, or any of the comparable sales in the original appraisal with the extraordinary assumption made that the information regarding these properties is accurate as of the date of the original appraisal. The use of extraordinary assumptions could significantly impact the conclusions and findings in the review appraisal if the information relied on for the extraordinary assumptions is found to be inaccurate.

HYPOTHETICAL CONDITIONS: Hypothetical conditions are contrary to what is known to exist but are asserted for the purpose of analysis. No hypothetical conditions were made as part of this appraisal review assignment.

## LIMITING CONDITIONS

## Certificate of Limiting Conditions:

1. The Review appraiser did not perform a physical inspection, interior or exterior, of the subject property or any of the comparable sales found in the appraisal under review or of the additional comparable sales provided to the Client.
2. The Review appraiser assumes no responsibility for the matters of a legal nature affecting the property which is the subject of this assignment or the title thereto, nor does the review appraiser render any opinion as to the title, which is assumed to be good and marketable.
3. The review appraiser assumes that there are no hidden or unapparent conditions of the property, subsoil, or structures, which would render it more or less valuable. The review appraiser assumes no responsibility for such conditions, or for the engineering which might be required to discover such factors.
4. Information, estimates, and opinions furnished to the review appraiser, and contained in the appraisal under review, were obtained from sources considered reliable and believed to be true and correct, unless stated elsewhere. If contradictory information is obtained and deemed reliable, and believed to be true and correct, the review appraiser will cite that source and the assumptions associated with that information. However, no responsibility for accuracy of such items furnished to the review appraiser can be assumed by the review appraiser.
5. Disclosure of the contents of the review report is governed by the USPAP and the Bylaws and Regulations of the professional appraisal organizations with which the review appraiser is affiliated.
6. No change of any item in the review report shall be made by anyone other the review appraiser and the review appraiser shall have no responsibility for any such unauthorized change.
7. The use of this review report is restricted to the client named within this report. Unless written consent is provided by the client and the review appraiser, use of this report by any other party is strictly prohibited.
8. The geographic competency to complete this limited scope review appraisal was acquired by the review appraiser's review and analysis of the original appraisal, the review and analysis of the supporting data that included both relevant area sales information, listing information and market information provided by additional recognized sources of real estate information.

## NOTICE TO THE HOME LOAN APPLICANT

In connection with your application for a home loan, the lender must disclose to you the score that a credit bureau distributed to users and the lender used in connection with your home loan, and the key factors affecting your credit scores.

The credit score is a computer generated summary calculated at the time of the request and is based on information a credit bureau or lender has on file. The scores are based on data about your credit history and payment patterns. Credit scores are important because they are used to assist the lender in determining whether you will obtain a loan. They may also be used to determine what interest rate you may be offered on the mortgage. Credit scores can change over time, depending on your conduct, how your credit history and payment patterns change, and how credit scoring technologies change.

Because the score is based on information in your credit history, it is very important that you review the credit-related information that is being furnished to make sure it is accurate. Credit records may vary from one company to another.

If you have questions about your credit score or the credit information that is furnished to you, contact the credit bureau at the address and telephone number provided with this notice or contact the lender, if the lender developed or generated the credit score. The credit bureau plays no part in the decision to take any action on the loan application and is unable to provide you with the specific reasons for the decision on a loan application.

If you have questions concerning the terms of the loan, contact the lender.

ATTACHMENT 4 TO JUDGMENT
It is further ordered:

# CHILD CUSTODY AND VISITATION 

1. The parties shall share joint legal custody of the minor children, ${ }^{\text {Tory }}$ (born February 1, 1997, Susan (born May 2, 1998), and Frank (born December 26, 1999). Respondent shall have Physical Custody of the three minor children, and Petitioner shall have Reasonable Visitation with the three minor children. It is anticipated Respondent and the children will be moving to Michigan on or about December 16, 2004. Petitioner's visitation shall be as follows:
a) For the month of December 2004: (1) every weekend from Friday at 6 p.m. to Sunday at 6 p.m.; (2) weekday visits as requested by Petitioner, with a pickup after work and a return home no later than 9 p.m.; 3) if Petitioner travels to Michigan for Christmas, then Respondent shall have the children on Christmas Eve and Christmas Day, and Petitioner will have the children on December 26 for Fran's birthday; (4) for the week of December 27, Petitioner shall have visitation as requested, with a return of the children to a home of Respondent's choosing by 9 p.m., unless the Parties agree otherwise.
b) Beginning January 2005 and continuing until the execution of a subsequent written agreement between the Parties or a Court order, while Petitioner resides in California and Respondent and the minor children reside in Michigan: (1) Petitioner shall have two weekends per month, beginning on Fridays at 6 p.m. with a return by 6 p.m. on the night before the next school day. The Parties have acknowledged that Petitioner may not be able to visit for two weekends in any given month. Petitioner shall provide Respondent with as much notice as possible regarding the weekends he would like visitation for, but at a minimum, Petitioner will provide seven (7) calendar days' notice to Respondent. Petitioner shall be responsible for all travel costs to Michigan for the visits, and for travel back and forth while in Michigan for the visits.
c) Beginning after Petitioner moves back to Michigan, and both Parties and the minor children all reside in Michigan, and remaining in effect until further written

agreement between the Parties or Court Order: (1) alternating weekends, beginning on Fridays at 6 p.m. to Sundays at 6 p.m.; (2) one weekday visit from 5:30 p.m. to a return no later than 8:30 p.m.; (3) floating and additional time as agreed and as permitted by the Parties' schedules, as agreed between the Parties
d) "Parenting Plan": Holidays and Breaks: (a) The Parties have acknowledged that Respondent had the entire Thanksgiving Week 2004 (through Friday November 26) as her Holiday Visitation and that she will have Christmas Eve and Christmas Day 2004, per her request. Beginning with New Years' Day on January 1, 2005, Respondent will have all the holiday visits through June 2005 while Petitioner resides in California. (b) In May 2005, prior to the end of the children's school year and the beginning of the 2005 summer break, the Parties will meet (telephonic is acceptable with facsimile transmissions) to develop a "Parenting Plan", which includes the children's school schedules for 2005-6, and the Holiday and Break visitation schedule for the remainder of 2005, including the 2005 summer break. The Parties understand and agree that Petitioner is entitled to two weeks of the 2005 summer break, which will be apportioned at the May 2005 meeting. If Petitioner wants the children to spend this break time in California with him, he will bear the costs of transporting the children and a chaperone (for the flight) to California.
e) No Child Support Penalties for Disproportionate Time Share: The Parties have acknowledged and agreed that Petitioner will not be penalized in the child support calculation if he is unable to fully exercise his visitation times as allotted above, prior to his move to Michigan, due to the unique circumstances of this move-away case. The Parties agree that the consideration for not penalizing Petitioner, if different time-share amounts actually occur, is Petitioner's agreement to let Respondent and the three (3) minor children move to Michigan immediately without Petitioner contesting the move, and the acknowledged costs and access difficulties Petitioner may experience as a result.
f) Custody and Visitation Effective through at least calendar year 2005: (a) This Custody and Visitation Order shall remain in effect until the execution of a subsequent written agreement between the Parties or a subsequent Court Order. However, the Parties shall meet in

October 2005 to review this Custody and Visitation Order, after both Parties have a better understanding of what occurs during the next twelve (12) months. (b) After the October 2005 Review, either Party may file a motion with a competent Court to modify this Custody and Visitation Order as if the Court were initially determining Custody and Visitation. (c) At the October 2005 Review, the Parties shall negotiate in good faith to develop and implement a Parenting Plan, including Visitation, Holidays and Break schedules. If the Parties are not able to finalize a Parenting Plan prior to January 1, 2006, for calendar year 2006, then the Parties will alternate Holidays and share equally breaks until a new Court Order is in place, with the Parties sharing equally the 2005 Christmas break and Petitioner having the latter week in the 2005 Christmas break, including December 31, 2005 and January 1, 2006. The Parties may apply to the Court for judicial intervention to finalize a Parenting Plan for 2006 and beyond.

For the duration of their minority, the Parties' three (3) children $\qquad$ shall bear ${ }^{\text {Augustine's }}$ surname, $\qquad$ and any other legal documents, and shall not assume any other surname or Angels future married name (if any), unless the Parties agree in writing to modify this Agreement.
20. CHILD SUPPORT. Augustine will pay to ${ }^{\text {Angels }}$, for Child Support for the three (3) minor children Terry (born 2/1/1997), Susan (born 5/2/1998), and Frank born 12/26/1999), the sum of $\$ 1.500$ per month, payable in equal one-half installments no later than the second and sixteenth days of each month, commencing on December 1, 2004, and continuing until written modification between the Parties or by Court order.
21. ASSUMPTIONS USED IN CALCULATING SUPPORT. The Parties made the following assumptions for purposes of the calculation of the foregoing Child Support, with the understanding that except as specifically provided herein, said assumptions would have no precedential effect on future Child Support proceedings, and are without prejudice to the rights of either Party to assert different facts.
(a) Parties' Employment: The next twelve (12) months contain many uncertainties for the Parties' employment situations, based on Angels' request to immediately move back to Michigan with the minor children and Augustine's eventual job search in Michigan. For this calculation, the Parties have agreed to use Augustine's current employment income of $\$ 6950$ per month as his income; and the compromise amount of $\$ 1500$ per month as Angels's income, based on their varying estimates ranging from zero to $\$ 3000 / \mathrm{mo}$. or more for her potential income. The Parties acknowledge that if Angels's income is actually higher or Augustine's income is actually lower for calendar year 2005, Child Support shall not be reduced prior to January 1, 2006;
(b) Time Share: The next twelve (12) months contain many uncertainties for the Parties'

time share with the minor children, based on Anguies move back to Michigan with the minor children and the great distance between California and Michigan, which could make travel costs high. The actual time-share percentages that will result between the minor children and the Parties are uncertain at this time. For the support calculation, the Parties used a time-share amount of approximately (20\%) twenty percent for Augustine and the children prior to Augustine's nove to Michigan.
(c) Matt's Travel Costs to Michigan for Visitation: The Parties acknowledge that Augustine will incur increased travel costs to Michigan for visitation while Augustine esides in California and Angola and the minor children live in Michigan. These increased costs were estimated at between three hundred dollars ( $\$ 300$ ) and one thousand dollars ( $\$ 1000$ ) per month, with the sum of $\$ 800 / \mathrm{mo}$. used in the Child Support calculation. The Parties acknowledge and agree tha Augustine's travel costs could be higher or lower, but are truly uncertain as of the Effective Date of this Agreement;
(d) Other Assumed Factors: Other assumed factors used in calculating the initial Child Support order are set forth in Exhibit "D," a DissoMaster calculation;
(e) Waiver of modification of the Assumptions through calendar year 2005: The Parties agree that they cannot modify these assumptions used to calculate Child Support prior to January 2006, as consideration for Anguies immediate move to Michigan with the minor children and Augustine's ugreement not to contest the move;
(f) Increase in Child Support If Matt Receives a raise in 2005: Notwithstanding the foregoing, if Augustine sceives a salary increase during calendar year 2005, Child Support shall be increased retroactive to the date of such increase in salary, using the new income and the other assumptions above, based on the California support guideline on the DissoMaster support calculation program.

# 22. CHILD SUPPORT PAYMENTS CONTINUE UNTIL FURTHER 

MODIFICATION: Except as provided above, the foregoing Child Support will continue until further modification by the Parties or a Court Order, but no modification of the assumptions is allowable prior to January 1, 2006. The Parties acknowledge and agree that this monthly amount could be higher or lower based on many variables, but due to the unique circumstances of this

move-away case, $\mathrm{A}_{\text {equat's }}$ request to move immediately, and the Parties' employment situations, the Parties agree that this amount is satisfactory for calendar year 2005;

# 23. MISCELLANEOUS OUT-OF-POCKET EXPENSES AND HEALTI' 

INSURANCE: The Parties acknowledge and agree that Matt will continue to pay one-half (1/2) of the Parties' out-of-pocket expenses for the children's health insurance, dental insurance, and extracurricular activities. The Parties agree that they will work together to seek the most affordable health care, including options through employment, and if one Party can get health care for the children through employment, that Party will be required to do so, with the Parties then sharing equally out-of-pocket health and dental care costs for the children. However, since Augustine currently pays Two Hundred Twenty-Nine Dollars (\$229) per month for the entire family for Kaiser Permanente Health Insurance, he will NOT be required to pay more than this amount over the next (12) Twelve months or unti Augustine obtains new employment in Michigan, whichever first occurs Augustine vill provide insurance coverage for the minor children through any health insurance available in such new employment in Michigan, after consultation witl Aiguita to implement the best insurance plan possible for the children.
24. DECEMBER 2005 REVIEW: The Parties agree to meet in December 2005 to review the Child Support Order, after the Custody and Visitation Order is also reviewed. The Parties will utilize the Michigan Friend of the Court guideline support formula, as it exists on December 31, 2005, to be effective on January 1, 2006.
25. MAINTAINING LIFE INSURANCE: Augustine shall maintain the Fortes Life Insurance policy, or other life insurance with a payout value of at least $\$ 350,000$ during the minority of the children, with not less than $\$ 175,000$ payable to Aiguita and not less than $\$ 175,000$ payable to the children in equal shares (one-third to each).
26. FAMILY CODE SECTION 4065 COMPLIANCE: The Parties acknowledge that (a) they are fully informed of their rights concerning Child Support; (b) the above Child Support provisions are being agreed to without coercion or duress; (c) this Agreement for Child Support

is in the children's best interests; and (d) the children's needs will be adequately met by this Child Support arrangement.

The Parties further declare their rights to Child Support have not been assigned to the county pursuant to section 11477 of the California Welfare and Institutions Code, and no public assistance application is presently pending.

The Parties further acknowledge that Child Support of the minor children is always subject to modification by a Court of competent jurisdiction at any time during the children's minority, and that this paragraph or any later Child Support Order is subject to modification.

As evidenced by Exhibit "D," and based on the assumptions set forth in paragraph 21, the parties believe the Child Support provided herein approximates guideline support.

# 27. NO SPOUSAL SUPPORT PAYABLE TO EITHER PARTY: TERMINATION OF JURISDICTION BY ANY COURT OVER SPOUSAL SUPPORT. 

The Parties acknowledge and agree th:Augustine took $\$ 8,000$ and Angela ook $\$ 23,000$ of Community Property money in October 2004. The Parties agree tha:Angela :an retain the $\$ 23,000$ she took for temporary Spousal Support and Attorney's Fees and Costs, without a right of reimbursement tc Augustine nd without Angela eeking any additional funds from:Augustine or temporary Spousal Support or Attorney's Fees and Costs.

Augustine and Angela nutually waive forever any claim for Spousal Support from the other Party. The Court shall have no jurisdiction to modify this Spousal Support provision or to award any Spousal Support to either Party, either now or in the future. The Parties agree that no Court in any State can modify this Spousal Support Order or award new Spousal Support to either Party, as of December 10, 2004, the Effective Date of this Agreement. This waiver is executed by both Parties with full disclosure of all the relevant facts to the other Party, is executed without duress by both Parties, and constitutes a full and final release of both Parties from paying Spousal Support to the other Party.
28. NO PENDENTE LITE ORDERS IN EXISTENCE. The Parties acknowledge and agree that there are no pendente lite orders in place now, nor have there ever been any pendente lite orders issued by the court in this dissolution action.

29. RECONCILIATION. If the Parties shall at any time reconcile after December 10, 2004, the Effective Date of this Agreement, then this Agreement, including all property transfers made or agreed to be made, shall remain in effect until modified or revoked by another written agreement signed by each Party and specifying the facts of (a) reconciliation and (b) modification of this Agreement.

# 30. INCORPORATION OF AGREEMENT INTO JUDICIAL ACTION. This 

Agreement shall be incorporated into and become a part of the Judgment of Dissolution currently pending in the Contra Costa County Superior Court, case number D04-05383, for the purposes of merging into the Dissolution of this Marriage and for any Court Orders requiring the Parties to perform the executory provisions of this Agreement, with the exception that any warranties contained in this Agreement shall survive its merger and be enforceable independently of the Judgment, by a breach of warranty action.

## 31. ENTRY OF JUDGMENT OF MARRIAGE DISSOLUTION. The Parties agree

that they will request the court to approve and enter a Judgment for an uncontested Dissolution of Marriage on December 10, 2004 at the currently scheduled Order to Show Cause Hearing, and that the marital status will be terminated effective May 20, 2005, the earliest available date under California law, pursuant to Dina's Response filed on November 19, 2005. Both Parties acknowledge that they will not be prejudiced by the entry of Judgment now or the termination of the marital status on May 20, 2005, for items such as health insurance and life insurance. Both Parties agree to timely file any additional documents requested by the Court to terminate the marital status on May 20, 2005. If either Party causes a delay in the termination of the marital status that adversely affects the other Party, than that Party shall indemnify the other Party for all losses or damages incurred by the other Party by reason of such delay, including any adverse tax liabilities. Pursuant to item \#17 above, Move to Michigan, once the Parties are restored to the status of single persons and all the other issues in this Dissolution have been resolved by agreement or Court Order, Matt will file a motion to transfer jurisdiction of this case to the State of Michigan.

32. ENTIRE AGREEMENT: MUTUAL RELEASES. The Parties intend this Agreement to be a final, full and complete settlement of all of their rights and obligations arising out of their Marriage. Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, each i arty releases the other Party from any and all debts, obligations, and liabilities owing to the other, whether incurred before or after December 10, 2004, the Effective Date of this Agreement. Each Party expressly releases and discharges the other Party, individually and for that Party's heirs, assigns, representatives, executors and administrators, and releases any right to claim against the other Party for the estate of the other Party, or to claim any interest in the property of the other Party, except as provided in this Agreement, whether such claims are known or unknown. Each Party expressly waives the provisions of California Civil Code section 1542, which provides:
"A general release does not extend to claims which the creditor does not know or suspect to exist in his favor at the time of executing the release, which if known by him must have materially affected his settlement with the debtor."
33. PARTIES AND PERSONS BOUND. This Agreement shall bind the Parties to the Agreement, and their respective heirs, assigns, representatives, executors and administrators and any other successors in interest.
34. COSTS OF ENFORCEMENT. In the event that either Party shall be required to bring any action or proceeding in any Court of competent jurisdiction to enforce any of the provisions of this Agreement, or any Court order made after merger of any provision of this Agreement in the Dissolution Judgment, the prevailing Party (as defined by the Court) in such action or proceeding shall be entitled to recover all costs of such enforcement proceeding, including reasonable costs and attorneys' fees as set by the Court. No such liability shall accrue unless ten days' (10) prior notice of the claimed default has been given to the alleged defaulting Party, and such Party may cure the default within that ten-day (10) period without liability for the other party's costs or fees.

35. EXECUTION OF INSTRUMENTS. The Parties agree that each Party will promptly execute and deliver to the other Party, upon request, any legal instrument, document of title or other legal document that may be necessary or convenient to carry out the provisions of this Agreement, including but not limited to, the division of property or confirmation of property set forth in this Agreement and the attached Exhibits. In addition, each Party agrees to remove the other Party's name from any joint credit cards, revolving credit accounts, letters of credit, or any other credit instruments or accounts that could subject the other Party to legal liability for debts incurred by using said accounts or instruments.
36. EXECUTION FORMALITIES. The Parties specifically agree that forthwith upon their execution of this Agreement, their respective signatures shall be acknowledged by a notary public, in their presence. The Parties further acknowledge that the date which is set forth on the first page of this Agreement is the actual date on which they and each of them are signing this Agreement, which will be different from the notarized date of this Agreement. This Agreement, and the final Judgment of Dissolution into which this Agreement has been merged, may be recorded at any time, and from time to time by either party in any place or office authorized by law for the recording of documents affecting title to or ownership status of property, real or personal, specifically including, but not limited to, any county in which either party resided during the marriage or after a final judgment of dissolution, and any county in which either party owns or may own real or personal property.
37. APPLICABLE LAW. This Agreement is executed in the State of California and shall be subject to and interpreted under the laws of California, except that any later modification to the Custody, Visitation, or Child Support Orders and Agreements may be interpreted pursuant to a Court of competent jurisdiction of another state.

38. MODIFICATION, REVOCATION AND TERMINATION. This Agreement may be altered, amended, modified, revoked or terminated only by an instrument in writing expressly referring to this Agreement, executed and signed by both Matt and Dina. Each of the Parties waives the right to claim, contend or assert in the future that this Agreement was modified, canceled, superseded or changed by oral agreement, course of conduct or estoppel. Nothing herein is intended, however, to restrict the power of a court of competent jurisdiction to modify provisions relating to custody, visitation or support of minor children.
39. INVALIDITY: SEVERALABILITY. This Agreement has been jointly negotiated between the Parties and was prepared by Augustine nd shall not be construed against either Party. If any term, provision or condition of this Agreement is later held by a court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid, void or unenforceable, the remainder of the provisions shall remain in full force and effect and shall in no way be affected, impaired or invalidated.

IN WITNESS THEREOF, the parties have executed this Agreement on the date set forth on this first page of this Agreement, December 10, 2004.

## NOTICE TO THE HOME LOAN APPLICANT

In connection with your application for a home loan, the lender must disclose to you the score that a credit bureau distributed to users and the lender used in connection with your home loan, and the key factors affecting your credit scores.

The credit score is a computer generated summary calculated at the time of the request and is based on information a credit bureau or lender has on file. The scores are based on data about your credit history and payment patterns. Credit scores are important because they are used to assist the lender in determining whether you will obtain a loan. They may also be used to determine what interest rate you may be offered on the mortgage. Credit scores can change over time, depending on your conduct, how your credit history and payment patterns change, and how credit scoring technologies change.

Because the score is based on information in your credit history, it is very important that you review the credit-related information that is being furnished to make sure it is accurate. Credit records may vary from one company to another.

If you have questions about your credit score or the credit information that is furnished to you, contact the credit bureau at the address and telephone number provided with this notice or contact the lender, if the lender developed or generated the credit score. The credit bureau plays no part in the decision to take any action on the loan application and is unable to provide you with the specific reasons for the decision on a loan application.

Because the score is based on information in your credit history, it is very important that you review the credit-related information that is being furnished to make sure it is accurate. Credit records may vary from one company to another.

If you have questions about your credit score or the credit information that is furnished to you, contact the consumer reporting agency at the address and telephone number provided with this notice or contact the lender, if the lender developed or generated the credit score. The consumer reporting agency plays no part in the decision to take any action on the loan application and is unable to provide you with the specific reasons for the decision on a loan application.

If you have questions concerning the terms of the loan, contact the lender.

The scores are based on data about your credit history and payment patterns. Credit scores are important because they are used to assist the lender in determining whether you will obtain a loan. They may also be used to determine what interest rate you may be offered on the mortgage. Credit scores can change over time, depending on your conduct, how your credit history and payment patterns change, and how credit scoring technologies change.

# Notice to the Home Loan Applicant 

In connection with your application for a home loan, the lender must disclose to you the score that a consumer reporting agency distributed to users and the lender used in connection with your home loan, and the key factors affecting your credit scores.

The credit score is a computer generated summary calculated at the time of the request and based on information that a consumer reporting agency or lender has on file. The scores are based on data about your credit history and payment patterns. Credit scores are important because they are used to assist the lender in determining whether you will obtain a loan. They may also be used to determine what interest rate you may be offered on the mortgage. Credit scores can change over time, depending on your conduct, how your credit history and payment patterns change, and how credit scoring technologies change.

Because the score is based on information in your credit history, it is very important that you review the credit-related information that is being furnished to make sure it is accurate. Credit records may vary from one company to another.

If you have questions about your credit score or the credit information that is furnished to you, contact the consumer reporting agency at the address and telephone number provided with this notice, or contact the lender, if the lender developed or generated the credit score. The consumer reporting agency plays no part in the decision to take any action on the loan application and is unable to provide you with specific reasons for the decision on a loan application.

If you have questions concerning the terms of the loan, contact the lender.

# Notice to the Home Loan Applicant 

In connection with your application for a home loan, the lender must disclose to you the score that a consumer reporting agency distributed to users and the lender used in connection with your home loan, and the key factors affecting your credit scores.

The credit score is a computer generated summary calculated at the time of the request and based on information that a consumer reporting agency or lender has on file. The scores are based on data about your credit history and payment patterns. Credit scores are important because they are used to assist the lender in determining whether you will obtain a loan. They may also be used to determine what interest rate you may be offered on the mortgage. Credit scores can change over time, depending on your conduct, how your credit history and payment patterns change, and how credit scoring technologies change.

Because the score is based on information in your credit history, it is very important that you review the credit-related information that is being furnished to make sure it is accurate. Credit records may vary from one company to another.

If you have questions about your credit score or the credit information that is furnished to you, contact the consumer reporting agency at the address and telephone number provided with this notice, or contact the lender, if the lender developed or generated the credit score. The consumer reporting agency plays no part in the decision to take any action on the loan application and is unable to provide you with specific reasons for the decision on a loan application.

If you have questions concerning the terms of the loan, contact the lender.

## 5.1.18

## Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN)

Enter past TIN in the appropriate box. The TIN provided must match the name given on line 1 to avoid backup withholding. For individuals, this is generally your social security number (SSN). However, for a resident alien, sole proprietor, or disengarded entity, see the Part I instructions on page 3. For other entities, it is your employer identification number (EIN). If you do not have a number, see How to get a TIN on page 3.

Note. If the account is in more than one name, see the instructions for line 1 and the chart on page 2-3 for guidelines on whose number to enter.

## 5.1.19

## Certification

Under penalties of perjury, I certify that:

1. The number shown on this form is my correct taxpayer identification number (or I am waiting for a number to be issued to me); and
2. I am not subject to backup withholding because: (a) I am exempt from backup withholding, or (b) I have not been notified by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) that I am subject to backup withholding as a result of a failure to report all interest or dividends, or (c) the IRS has notified me that I am no longer subject to backup withholding; and
3. I am a U.S. citizen or other U.S. person (defined below); and
4. The FATCA code(s) entered on this form (if any) indicating that I am exempt from FATCA reporting is correct.

Certification instructions. You must cross out item 2 above if you have been notified by the IRS that you are currently subject to backup withholding because you have failed to report all interest and dividends on your tax return. For real estate transactions, item 2 does not apply. For mortgage interest paid, acquisition or abandonment of secured property, cancellation of debt, contributions to an individual retirement arrangement (IRA), and generally, payments other than interest and dividends, you are not required to sign the certification, but you must provide your correct TIN. See the instructions on page 3.

## General Instructurits

Section references are to the Internal Revenue Code unless otherwise noted.

Future developments. Information about developments affecting Form W-9 (such as legislation enacted after we release it) is at www.irs.gov/fwii.

## Purpose of Form

An individual or entity (Form W-9 requester) who is required to file an information return with the IRS must obtain your correct taxpayer identification number (TIN) which may be your social security number (SSN), individual taxpayer identification number (ITIN), adoption taxpayer identification number (ATIN), or employer identification number (EIN), to report on an information return the amount paid to you, or other amount reportable on an information return. Examples of information returns include, but are not limited to, the following:

- Form 1099-INT (interest earned or paid)
- Form 1099-ERV (dividends, including those from stocks or mutual funds)
- Form 1099-MISC (various types of income, prizes, awards, or gross proceeds)
- Form 1099-B (stock or mutual fund sales and certain other transactions by brokers)
- Form 1099-S (proceeds from real estate transactions)
- Form 1099-K (merchant card and third party network transactions)
- Form 1098 (home mortgage interest), 1098-E (student loan interest), 1098-T (tution)
- Form 1099-C (canceled debt)
- Form 1099-A (acquisition or abandonment of secured property)

By signing the filled-out form, you:

1. Certify that the TIN you are giving is correct (or you are waiting for a number to be issued).
2. Certify that you are not subject to backup withholding, or
3. Claim exemption from backup withholding if you are a U.S. exempt payee. If applicable, you are also certifying that as a U.S. person, your allocable share of any partnership income from a U.S. trade or business is not subject to the withholding tax on foreign partners' share of effectively connected income, and
4. Certify that FATCA code(s) entered on this form (if any) indicating that you are exempt from the FATCA reporting, is correct. See What is FATCA reporting? on page 2 for further information.

Note. If you are a U.S. person and a requester gives you a form other than Form W-9 to request your TIN, you must use the requester's form if it is substantially similar to this Form W-9.

Definition of a U.S. person. For federal tax purposes, you are considered a U.S. person if you are:

- An individual who is a U.S. citizen or U.S. resident alien;

A partnership, corporation, company, or association created or organized in the United States or under the laws of the United States;

- An estate (other than a foreign estate), or
- A domestic trust (as defined in Regulations section 301.7701-7).

Special rules for partnerships. Partnerships that conduct a trade or business in the United States are generally required to pay a withholding tax under section 1446 on any foreign partners' share or effectively connected taxable income from such business. Further, in certain cases where a Form W-9 has not been received, the rules under section 1446 require a partnership to presume that a partner is a foreign person, and pay the section 1446 withholding tax. Therefore, if you are a U.S. person that is a partner in a partnership conducting a trade or business in the United States, provide Form W-9 to the partnership to establish your U.S. status and avoid section 1446 withholding on your share of partnership income.

In the cases below, the following person must give Form W-9 to the partnership for purposes of establishing its U.S. status and avoiding withholding on its allocable share of net income from the partnership conducting a trade or business in the United States

- In the case of a disorganized entity with a U.S. owner, the U.S. owner of the disregarded entity and not the entity.
- In the case of a grantor trust with a U.S. grantor or other U.S. owner, generally, the U.S. grantor or other U.S. owner of the grantor trust and not the trust, and
- In the case of a U.S. trust (other than a grantor trust), the U.S. trust (other than a grantor trust) and not the beneficiaries of the trust.

Foreign person. If you are a foreign person or the U.S. branch of a foreign bank that has elected to be treated as a U.S. person, do not use Form W-9. Instead, use the appropriate Form W-9 or Form 9233 (see Publication 515. Withholding of Tax on Nonresident Aliens and Foreign Entities).

Nonresident alien who becomes a resident alien. Generally, only a nonresident alien individual may use the terms of a tax treaty to reduce or eliminate U.S. tax on certain types of income. However, most tax treaties contain a provision known as a 'saving clause.' Exceptions specified in the saving clause may permit an exemption from tax to continue for certain types of income even after the payee has otherwise become a U.S. resident alien for tax purposes.

If you are a U.S. resident alien who is relying on an exception contained in the saving clause of a tax treaty to claim an exemption from U.S. tax on certain types of income, you must attach a statement to Form W-9 that specifies the following five items.

The treaty country. Generally, this must be the same treaty under which you claimed exemption from tax as a nonresident alien.
2. The treaty article addressing the income.
3. The article number (or location) in the tax treaty that contains the saving clause and its exceptions.
4. The type and amount of income that qualifies for the exemption from tax.
5. Sufficient facts to justify the exemption from tax under the terms of the treaty article.

Example. Article 20 of the U.S.-China income tax treaty allows an exemption from tax for scholarship income received by a Chinese student temporarily present in the United States. Under U.S. law, this student will become a resident alien for tax purposes if his or her stay in the United States exceeds 5 calendar years. However, paragraph 2 of the first Protocol to the U.S.-China treaty (dated April 30, 1984) allows the provisions of Article 20 to continue to apply even after the Chinese student becomes a resident alien of the United States. A Chinese student who qualifies for this exception (under paragraph 2 of the first protocol) and is relying on this exception to claim an exemption from tax on his or her scholarship or fellowship income would attach to Form W-9 a statement that includes the information described above to support that exemption.
If you are a nonresident alien or a foreign entity, give the requester the appropriate completed Form W-8 or Form 9233.

# Backup Withholding 

What is backup withholding? Persons making certain payments to you must under certain conditions withhold and pay to the IRS 28% of such payments. The in called "backup withholding." Payments that may be subject to backup withholding include interest, tax-exempt interest, dividends, broker and barter exchange transactions, rents, royalties, nonemployes, gas, payments made in settlement of payment card and third party network transactions, and certain payments from fishing boat operators. Real estate transactions are not subject to backup withholding.

You will not be subject to backup withholding on payments you receive if you give the requester your correct TIN, make the proper certifications, and report all your taxable interest and dividends on your tax return.

Payments you receive will be subject to backup withholding if:

1. You do not furnish your TIN to the requester.
2. You do not certify your TIN when required (see the PartII instructions on page 4 for details).
3. The IRS tells the requester that you furnished an incorrect TIN.

## LOAN 8: $\quad$ CAGN9115931600

4. The IRS tells you that you are subject to backup withholding because you did not report all your interest and dividends on your tax return (for reportable interest and dividends only), or
5. You do not certify to the requester that you are not subject to backup withholding under 4 above (for reportable interest and dividend accounts opened after 1983 only).

Certain payers and payments are exempt from backup withholding. See Exempt payee code on page 3 and the separate instructions for the Requester of Form W-9 for more information.

Also see Special rules for partnerships on this page.

## What is FATCA reporting?

The Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act (FATCA) requires a participating foreign financial institution to report all United States account matters that are specified United States persons. Certain payees are exempt from FATCA reporting. See Exemption from FATCA reporting code on page 3 and the instructions for the Requester of Form W-9 for more information.

## Updating Your Information

You must provide updated information to any person to whom you claimed to be an exempt payee if you are no longer an exempt payee and anticipate receiving reportable payments in the future from this person. For example, you may need to provide updated information if you are a C corporation that elects to be an S corporation, or if you no longer are tax exempt. In addition, you must furnish a new Form W-9 if the name or TIN changes for the account; for example, if the grantor of a grantor trust dies.

## Penalties

Failure to furnish TIN. If you fail to furnish your correct TIN to a requester, you are subject to a penalty of $\$ 50$ for each such failure unless your failure is due to reasonable cause and not to willful neglect.

Civil penalty for false information with respect to withholding. If you make a false statement with no reasonable basis that results in no backup withholding, you are subject to a $\$ 500$ penalty.

Criminal penalty for falsifying information. WARsily falsifying certifications or affirmations may subject you to criminal penalties including fines and or imprisonment.

Wesse of TINs. If the requester discloses or uses TINs in violation of federal law, the requester may be subject to civil and criminal penalties.

## Specific Instructions

## Line 1

If the Form W-9 is for a joint account, list first, and then circle, the name of the person or entity whose number you entered in Part I of Form W-9.
a. Individual. Generally, enter the name shown on your tax return. If you have changed your last name without informing the Social Security Administration (SSA) of the name change, enter your first name, the last name as shown on your social security card, and your new last name.

Note. TIN applicant: Enter your individual name as 8 was entered on your Form W-7 application, line 1a. This should also be the same as the name you entered on the Form 1040/1040A/1040EZ; you filed with your application.
b. Sole proprietor or single-member LLC. Enter your individual name as shown on your 1040/1040A/1040EZ or line 1. You may enter your business, trade, or "doing business as" (DBA) name on line 2.
c. Partnership, LLC that is not a single-member, LLC, C Corporation, or S Corporation. Enter the entity's name as shown on the entity's tax return on line 1 and any business, trade, or DBA name on line 2.

e. Disorganized entity. For U.S. federal tax purposes, an entity that is disregarded as an entity separate from its owner is treated as a "disorganized entity." See Regulations section 301.7701-2(b2)(b). Enter the owner's name on line 1. The name of the entity entered on line 1 should never be a disregarded entity. The name on line 1 should be the name shown on the income tax return on which the income should be reported. For example, if a foreign LLC that is treated as a disregarded entity for U.S. federal tax purposes has a single owner that is a U.S. person, the U.S. owner's name is required to be provided on line 1. If the direct owner of the entity is also a disregarded entity, enter the first owner that is not disregarded for federal tax purposes. Enter the disregarded entity's name on line 2.

If the LLC has filed Form 8532 or 2553 to be taxed as a corporation, check the "Limited Liability Company" box and in the space provided enter "C" for C corporation or " 0 " for 0 corporation. If it is a single-member LLC that is a disregarded entity, do not check the "Limited Liability Company" box: instead check the first box in line 3 "Individual/sole proprietor or single-member LLC."

| How to get a TIN. If you do not have a TIN, apply for one immediately. To apply for an SSN, get Form SS-5, Application for a Social Security Card, from your local SSA office or get this form online at www.ssa.gov. You may also get this form by calling 1-800-772-1213. Use Form W-7, Application for IRS; Individual Taxpayer Identification Number, to apply for an EIN, or Form SS-4, Application for Employer Identification Number, to apply for an EIN. You can apply for an EIN online by accessing the IRS website at www.irs.gov/businesses and clicking on Employer Identification Number (EIN) under Starting a Business. You can get Forms W-7 and SS-4 from the IRS by reading IRS.gov or by calling 1-800-TAX-FORM (1-800-829-3676). <br> If you are asked to complete Form W-9 but do not have a TIN, apply for a TIN and write "Applied For" in the space for the TIN, sign and date the form, and give it to the requester. For interest and dividend payments, and certain payments made with respect to readily tradable instruments, generally you will have 60 days to get a TIN and give it to the requester before you are subject to backup withholding on payments. The 60-day rule does not apply to other types of payments. You will be subject to backup withholding on all such payments until you provide your TIN to the requester. |  |
| Note: Entering "Applied For" means that you have already applied for a TIN or that you intend to apply for one soon. |  |
| Caudate: A disregarded U.S. entity that has a foreign owner must use the appropriate Form W-9. |  |

Future developments. Information about developments affecting Form W-9 (such as legislation enacted after we release it) is at www.irs.gov/fw9

## Purpose of Form

An individual or entity (Form W-9 requester) who is required to file an information return with the IRS must obtain your correct taxpayer identification number (TIN) which may be your social security number (SSN), individual taxpayer identification number (ITIN), adoption taxpayer identification number (ATIN), or employer identification number (EIN), to report on an information return the amount paid to you, or other amount reportable on an information return. Examples of information returns include, but are not limited to, the following:

- Form 1099-RIT (interest earned or paid)
- Form 1099-DIV (dividends, including those from stocks or mutual funds)
- Form 1099-MISC (various types of income, prizes, awards, or gross proceeds)
- Form 1099-B (stock or mutual fund sales and certain other transactions by brokers)
- Form 1099-S (proceeds from real estate transactions)
- Form 1099-K (merchant card and third party network transactions)
- Form 1098 (home mortgage interest), 1098-E (student loan interest), 1098-T (tution)
- Form 1099-C (canceled debt)
- Form 1099-A (acquisition or abandonment of secured property)

Use Form W-9 only if you are a U.S. person (including a resident alien), to provide your correct TIN.

If you do not return Form W-9 to the requester with a TIN, you might be subject to backup withholding. See What is backup withholding? on page 2 .

By signing the filled-out form, you:

1. Certify that the TIN you are giving is correct (or you are waiting for a number to be issued)
2. Certify that you are not subject to backup withholding, or
3. Claim exemption from backup withholding if you are a U.S. exempt payee. If applicable, you are also certifying that as a U.S. person, your allocable share of any partnership income from a U.S. trade or business is not subject to the withholding tax on foreign partners' share of effectively connected income, and
4. Certify that FATCA code(s) entered on this form (if any) indicating that you are exempt from the FATCA reporting, is correct. See What is FATCA reporting? on page 2 for further information.

Note. If you are a U.S. person and a requester gives you a form other than Form W-9 to request your TIN, you must use the requester's form if it is substantially similar to this Form W-9.

Definition of a U.S. person. For federal tax purposes, you are considered a U.S. person if you are:

- An individual who is a U.S. citizen or U.S. resident alien;

- A partnership, corporation, company, or association created or organized in the United States or under the laws of the United States; - An estate (other than a foreign estate); or
- A domestic trust (as defined in Regulations section 301.7701-7).

Special rules for partnerships. Partnerships that conduct a trade or business in the United States are generally required to pay a withholding tax under section 1446 on any foreign partners' share of effectively connected taxable income from such business. Further, in certain cases where a Form W-8 tax not been received, the rules under section 1446 require a partnership to presume that a partner is a foreign person, and pay the section 1446 withholding tax. Therefore, if you are a U.S. person that is a partner in a partnership conducting a trade or business in the United States, provide Form W-8 to the partnership to establish your U.S. status and avoid section 1446 withholding on your share of partnership income.

In the cases below, the following person must give Form W-8 to the partnership for purposes of establishing its U.S. status and avoiding withholding on its allocable share of net income from the partnership conducting a trade or business in the United States:

- In the case of a disorganized entity with a U.S. owner, the U.S. owner of the disorganized entity and not the entity;
- In the case of a grantor trust with a U.S. grantor or other U.S. owner, generally, the U.S. grantor or other U.S. owner of the grantor trust and not the trust; and
- In the case of a U.S. trust (other than a grantor trust), the U.S. trust (other than a grantor trust) and not the beneficiaries of the trust.

Foreign person. If you are a foreign person or the U.S. branch of a foreign bank that has elected to be treated as a U.S. person, do not use Form W-8. Instead, use the appropriate Form W-8 or Form 3223 (see Publication 515, Withholding of Tax on Nonresident Aliens and Foreign Entities).

Nonresident alien who becomes a resident alien. Generally, only a nonresident alien individual may use the terms of a tax treaty to reduce or eliminate U.S. tax on certain types of income. However, most tax treaties contain a provision known as a 'saving clause.' Exceptions specified in the saving clause may permit an exemption from tax to continue for certain types of income even after the payee has otherwise become a U.S. resident alien for tax purposes.

If you are a U.S. resident alien who is relying on an exception contained in the saving clause of a tax treaty to claim an exemption from U.S. tax on certain types of income, you must attach a statement to Form W-8 that specifies the following five items:

1. The treaty country. Generally, this must be the same treaty under which you claimed exemption from tax as a nonresident alien.
2. The treaty article addressing the income.
3. The article number (or location) in the tax treaty that contains the saving clause and its exceptions.
4. The type and amount of income that qualifies for the exemption from tax.
5. Sufficient facts to justify the exemption from tax under the terms of the treaty article.

Example. Article 22 of the U.S.-China income tax treaty allows an exemption from tax for scholarship income received by a Chinese student temporarily present in the United States. Under U.S. law, this student will become a resident alien for tax purposes if his or her stay in the United States exceeds 5 calendar years. However, paragraph 2 of the first Protocol to the U.S.-China treaty (dated April 30, 1984) allows the provisions of Article 20 to continue to apply even after the Chinese student becomes a resident alien of the United States. A Chinese student who qualifies for this exception (under paragraph 2 of the first protocol) and is relying on this exception to claim an exemption from tax on his or her scholarship or fellowship income would attach to Form W-8 a statement that includes the information described above to support that exemption.
If you are a nonresident alien or a foreign entity, give the requester the appropriate completed Form W-8 or Form 8233.

# Backup Withholding 

What is backup withholding? Persons making certain payments to you must under certain conditions withhold and pay to the IRS 28\% of such payments. This is called 'backup withholding.' Payments that may be subject to backup withholding include interest: (be-exempt interest, dividends, broker and barter exchange transactions, rents, royalties, nonemployers pay, payments made in settlement of payment card and third party network transactions, and certain payments from fishing boat operators. Real estate transactions are not subject to backup withholding.

You will not be subject to backup withholding on payments you receive if you give the requester your correct TIN, make the proper certifications, and report all your taxable interest and dividends on your tax return.

Payments you receive will be subject to backup withholding if:

1. You do not furnish your TIN to the requester.
2. You do not certify your TIN when required (see the PortInstructions on page 4 for details).
3. The IRS tells the requester that you furnished an incorrect TIN.

4. The IRS tells you that you are subject to backup withholding because you did not report all your interest and dividends on your tax return (for reportable interest and dividends only), or
5. You do not certify to the requester that you are not subject to backup withholding under 4 above (for reportable interest and dividend accounts opened after 1983 only).

Certain payees and payments are exempt from backup withholding. See Exempt payee code on page 3 and the separate instructions for the Requester of Form W-8 for more information.

Also see Special rules for partnerships on this page.

## What is FATCA reporting?

The Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act (FATCA) requires a participating foreign financial institution to report all United States account holders that are specified United States persons. Certain payees are exempt from FATCA reporting. See Exemption from FATCA reporting code on page 3 and the instructions for the Requester of Form W-8 for more information.

## Updating Your information

You must provide updated information to any person to whom you claimed to be an exempt payee if you are no longer an exempt payee and anticipate receiving reportable payments in the future from this person. For example, you may need to provide updated information if you are a C corporation that elects to be an S corporation, or if you no longer are tax exempt. In addition, you must furnish a new Form W-8 if the name or TIN changes for the account; for example, if the grantor of a grantor trust dies.

## Penalties

Failure to furnish TIN. If you fail to furnish your correct TIN to a requester, you are subject to a penalty of $\$ 50$ for each such failure unless your failure is due to reasonable cause and not to willful neglect.

CIVS penalty for false information with respect to withholding. If you make a false statement with no reasonable basis that results in no backup withholding, you are subject to a $\$ 500$ penalty.

Criminal penalty for falsifying information. I-08fully falsifying certifications or affirmations may subject you to criminal penalties including fines and/ or imprisonment.

Misuse of TINs. If the requester discloses or uses TINs in violation of federal law, the requester may be subject to civil and criminal penalties.

## Line 5

Enter your address (number, street, and apartment or suite number). This is where the requester of this Form W-9 will mail your information returns.

## Line 6

Enter your city, state, and ZIP code.

## Part I. Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN)

Enter your TIN in the appropriate box. If you are a resident alien and you do not have and are not eligible to get an SSN, your TIN is your IRS individual/taxpayer identification number (ITIN). Enter it in the social security number box. If you do not have an ITIN, see How to get a TIN below.
If you are a sole proprietor and you have an EIN, you may enter either your SSN or EIN. However, the IRS prefers that you use your SSN.
If you are a single-member LLC that is disregarded as an entity separate from its owner (see Limited Liability Company (LLC) on this page), enter the owner's SSN (or EIN, if the owner has one). Do not enter the disregarded entity's EIN. If the LLC is classified as a corporation or partnership, enter the entity's EIN.
Note. See the chart on page 4 for further clarification of name and TIN combinations.

How to get a TIN. If you do not have a TIN, apply for one immediately. To apply for an SSN, get Form 55-5. Application for a Social Security Card, from your local SSA office or get this form online at www.ssa.gov. You may also get this form by calling 1-800-772-1213. Use Form W-7. Application for IRS Individual Taxpayer Identification Number, to apply for an EIN. You can apply for an EIN online by accessing the IRS website at www.irs.gov/businesses and clicking on Employer Identification Number (EIN) under Starting a Business. You can get Forms W-7 and SS-4 from the IRS by visiting IRS.gov or by calling 1-800-TAX-FORN (1-800-829-3676).
If you are asked to complete Form W-9 but do not have a TIN, apply for a TIN and write "Applied For" in the space for the TIN, sign and date the form, and get it to the requester. For interest and dividend payments, and certain payments made with respect to readily tradable instruments, generally you will have 60 days to get a TIN and give it to the requester before you are subject to backup withholding on payments. The 60-day rule does not apply to other types of payments. You will be subject to backup withholding on all such payments until you provide your TIN to the requester.

Note. Entering "Applied For" means that you have already applied for a TIN or that you intend to apply for one soon.
Caution: A disregarded U.S. entity that has a foreign owner must use the appropriate Form W-8.


[^0]:    ${ }^{1}$ See Form 1099-MISC, Miscellaneous Income, and its instructions.
    ${ }^{2}$ However, the following payments made to a corporation and reputable on Form 1099-MISC are not exempt from backup withholding: medical and health care payments, attorney's fees, gross proceeds paid to an attorney reportable under section 604(b), and payments for services paid by a federal executive agency.

# Part II. Certification 

To establish is the withholding agent that you are a U.S. person, or resident alien, sign Form W-9. You may be requested to sign by the withholding agent even if items 1, 4, or 5 below indicate otherwise.

For a joint account, only the person whose TIN is shown in Part I should sign (when required); in the case of a disregarded entity, the person identified on line 1 must sign. Exempt payees, see Exempt payee code earlier.

Signature requirements. Complete the certification as indicated in items 1 through 5 below

1. Interest, dividend, and barter exchange accounts opened before 1984 and broker accounts considered active during 1983. You must give your correct TIN, but you do not have to sign the certification.
2. Interest, dividend, barter, and barter exchange accounts opened after 1983 and broker accounts considered inactive during 1983. You must sign the certification or backup withholding will apply. If you are subject to backup withholding and you are merely providing your correct TIN to the requester, you must cross out item 2 in the certification before signing the form.
3. Real estate transactions. You must sign the certification. You may cross out item 2 of the certification.
4. Other payments. You must give your correct TIN, but you do not have to sign the certification unless you have been notified that you have previously given an incorrect TIN. "Other payments" include payments made in the course of the requester's trade or business for rents, royalties, goods (other than bills for merchandise), medical and health care services (including payments to corporations), payments to a nonemployee for services, payments made in settlement of payment card and third party network transactions, payments to certain fishing boat crew members and fishermen, and gross proceeds paid to attorneys (including payments to corporations).
5. Mortgage interest paid by you, acquisition or abandonment of secured property, cancellation of debt, qualified tuition program payments (under section 629), IRA, Covardell SSA, Archer MSA or HSA contributions or distributions, and pension distributions.

## Secure Your Tax Records from Identity Theft

Identity theft occurs when someone uses your personal information such as your name, SSN, or other identifying information, without your permission, to commit fraud or other crimes. An identity theft may use your SSN to get a job or may file a tax return using your SSN to receive a refund.

So reduce your risk:

- Protect your SSN,
- Ensure your employer is protecting your SSN, and
- Be careful when choosing a tax preparer.
If your tax records are affected by identity theft and you receive a notice from the IRS, respond right away to the name and phone number printed on the IRS notice or letter.
If your tax records are not currently affected by identity theft but you think you are at risk due to a lost or stolen purse or wallet, questionable credit card activity or credit report, contact the IRS Identity Theft Hotline at 1-800-508-4490 or submit Form 14039.

For more information, see Publication 4535, Identity Theft Prevention and Victim Assistance.

Victims of identity theft who are experiencing economic harm or a system problem, or are seeking help in resolving tax problems that have not been resolved through normal channels, may be eligible for Taxpayer Advocate Service (TAS) assistance. You can reach TAS by calling the TAS toll-free case intake line at 1-877-777-4778 or T71/TDD 1-800-829-4059.

Protect yourself from suspicious emails or phishing schemes. Ploisting is the creation and use of email and websites designed to mimic legitimate business emails and websites. The most common act is sending an email to a user falsely claiming to be an established legitimate enterprise in an attempt to scam the user into surrendering private information that will be used for identity theft.

The IRS does not initiate contacts with taxpayers via emails. Also, the IRS does not request personal detailed information through email or ask taxpayers for the PIN numbers, passwords, or similar secret access information for their credit card, bank, or other financial accounts.

If you receive an unsolicited email claiming to be from the IRS, forward this message to phishing@irs.gov. You may also report misuse of the IRS name, logo, or other IRS property to the Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration (TGTX) at 1-800-366-4484. You can forward suspicious emails to the Federal Trade Commission at: spem@use.gov or contact them at www.ftc.gov/offieff or 1-877-031145/7.1.1.477-438-4336).

Visit IRS.gov to learn more about identity theft and how to reduce your risk.

## Privacy Act Notice

Section 6109 of the Internal Revenue Code requires you to provide your correct TIN to persons (including federal agencies) who are required to file information returns with the IRS to report interest, dividends, or certain other income paid to you; mortgage interest you paid; the acquisition or abandonment of secured property; the cancellation of debt; or contributions you made to an IRA, Archer MSA, or HSA. The person collecting this form uses the information on the form to file information returns with the IRS, reporting the above information. Routine uses of this information include giving it to the Department of Justice for civil and criminal litigation and to other, states, the District of Columbia, and U.S. commonwealths and possessions for use in administering their laws. The information also may be disclosed to other countries under a treaty, to federal and state agencies to enforce civil and criminal laws, or to federal law enforcement and intelligence agencies to combat terrorism. You must provide your TIN whether or not you are required to file a tax return. Under section 3409, payers must generally withhold a percentage of taxable interest, dividend, and certain other payments to a payer who does not give a TIN to the payer. Certain penalties may also apply for providing false or fraudulent information.

# Choosing the best mortgage for you 

You're starting to look for a mortgage or want to confirm you made a good decision.

To make the most of your mortgage, you need to decide what works for you and then shop around to find it. In this section, you'll find eight steps to get the job done right.

## 1. Define what affordable means to you

Only you can decide how much you are comfortable paying for your housing each month. In most cases, your lender can consider only if you are able to repay your mortgage, not whether you will be comfortable repaying your loan. Based on your whole financial picture, think about whether you want to take on the mortgage payment plus the other costs of homeownership such as appliances, repairs, and maintenance.

## IN THIS SECTION

1. Define what affordable means to you
2. Understand your credit
3. Pick the mortgage type that works for you
4. Choose the right down payment for you
5. Understand the tradeoff between points and interest rate
6. Shop with several lenders
7. Choose your mortgage
8. Avoid pitfalls and handle problems

## T

THE TALK
Ask your spouse, a loved one, or friend about what affordable means to you:
"What's more important-a bigger home with a larger mortgage or more financial flexibility?"
"How much do we want to budget for all the monthly housing costs, including repairs, furniture, and new appliances?"
"What will a mortgage payment mean for other financial goals?"

# KNOW YOUR NUMBERS 

Calculate the home payment you can take on by filling in the worksheets below:
Think about what an affordable home loan looks like for you. These worksheets can help. First, estimate your total monthly home payment. Second, look at the percentage of your income that will go toward your monthly home payment. Third, look at how much money you will have available to spend on the rest of your monthly expenses.

## Step 1. Estimate your total monthly home payment by adding up the items below

Your total monthly home payment is more than just your mortgage. There are more expenses that go along with owning your home. Start with estimates and adjust as you go.

MONTHLY ESTIMATE

Principal and interest (P\&I)
Your principal and interest payment depends on your home loan amount, the interest rate, and the number of years it takes to repay the loan. Principal is the amount you pay each month to reduce the loan balance. Interest is the amount you pay each month to borrow money. Many principal and interest calculators are available online.

| Mortgage insurance |  |
| :-- | :-- |
| Mortgage insurance is often required for loans with less than a 20\% <br> down payment. | $\div$ |
| Property taxes |  |
| The local assessor or auditor's office can help you estimate property <br> taxes for your area. If you know the yearly amount, divide by 12 and <br> write in the monthly amount. | $\div \$$ |
| Homeowner's insurance <br> You can call one or more insurance agents to get an estimate for homes <br> in your area. Ask if flood insurance is required. | $\div \$$ |
| Homeowner's association or condominium fees, if they apply <br> Condominiums and other planned communities often require <br> homeowner's association (HOA) fees. | $\div \$$ |
| My estimated total monthly home payment | $=$ |

# Step 2. Estimate the percentage of your income spent on your monthly home payment 

Calculate the percentage of your total monthly income that goes toward your total monthly home payment each month. A mortgage lending rule of thumb is that your total monthly home payment should be at or below $28 \%$ of your total monthly income before taxes. Lenders may approve you for more or for less depending on your overall financial picture.

| $\$$ | $\div \frac{\$}{100}$ | $\%$ |
| :--: | :--: | :--: |
| My estimated total monthly home payment (from step 1) | My total monthly income before taxes | Percentage of my income going toward my monthly home payment |

## Step 3. Estimate what is left after subtracting your monthly debts

To determine whether you are comfortable with your total monthly home payment, figure out how much of your income is left after you pay for your housing plus your other monthly debts.

| Total monthly income after taxes | \$ |
| :--: | :--: |
| My estimated total monthly home payment (from step 1) |  |
| Monthly car payment(s) | $-\$$ |
| Monthly student loan payment(s) | $-\$$ |
| Monthly credit card payment(s) | $-\$$ |
| Other monthly payments, such as child support or alimony | $-\$$ |
| Total monthly income minus all debt payments | $=\$$ |
| This money must cover your utilities, groceries, child care, health insurance, repairs, and everything else. If this isn't enough, consider options such as buying a less expensive home or paying down debts. |  |

## Step 4. Your choice

I am comfortable with a total monthly home payment of:

## 2. Understand your credit

Your credit, your credit scores, and how wisely you shop for a loan that best fits your needs have a significant impact on your mortgage interest rate and the fees you pay. To improve your credit and your chances of getting a better mortgage, get current on your payments and stay current. About 35\% of your credit scores are based on whether or not you pay your bills on time. About 30\% of your credit scores are based on how much debt you owe. That's why you may want to consider paying down some of your debts.

## RESEARCH STARTER

Check out interest rates and make sure you're getting the credit you've earned.
$\square$ Get your credit report at annualcreditreport.com and check it for errors. If you find mistakes, submit a request to each of the credit bureaus asking them to fix the mistake. For more information about correcting errors on your credit report, visit consumerfinance.gov/askcfpb.
$\square$ For more on home loans and credit, visit consumerfinance.gov/owning-a-home.

## NOW

- If your credit score is below 700, you will likely pay more for your mortgage.
- Most credit scoring models are built so you can shop for a mortgage within a certain period-generally between 14 days and 45 days-with little or no impact on your score. If you shop outside of this period, any change triggered by shopping should be minor-a small price to pay for saving money on a mortgage loan.

IN THE FUTURE

- If you work on improving your credit and wait to buy a home, you will likely save money. Some people who improve their credit save $\$ 50$ or $\$ 100$ on a typical monthly mortgage payment.
- An average consumer who adopts healthy credit habits, such as paying bills on time and paying down credit cards, could see a credit score improvement in three months or more.

IN THE FUTURE

- If you work on improving your credit and wait to buy a home, you will likely save money. Some people who improve their credit save $\$ 50$ or $\$ 100$ on a typical monthly mortgage payment.
- An average consumer who adopts healthy credit habits, such as paying bills on time and paying down credit cards, could see a credit score improvement in three months or more.

EXPERIENCE
Check one:
$\square$ I will go with the credit I have.
OR
$\square$ I will wait a few months or more and work to improve my credit.

# 3. Pick the mortgage type-fixed or adjustable-that works for you 

With a fixed-rate mortgage, your principal and interest payment stays the same for as long as you have your loan.

- Consider a fixed-rate mortgage if you want a predictable payment.
- You may be able to refinance later if interest rates fall or your credit or financial situation improves.

With an adjustable-rate mortgage (ARM), your payment often starts out lower than with a fixed-rate loan, but your rate and payment could increase quickly. It is important to understand the trade-offs if you decide on an ARM.

- Your payment could increase a lot, often by hundreds of dollars a month.
- Make sure you are confident you know what your maximum payment could be and that you can afford it.

Planning to sell your home within a short period of time? That's one reason some people consider an ARM. But, you probably shouldn't count on being able to sell or refinance. Your financial situation could change. Home values may go down or interest rates may go up.

You can learn more about ARMs in the Consumer Handbook on Adjustable Rate Mortgages (files.consumerfinance.gov/f/201401_cfpb_booklet_charm.pdf) or by visiting consumerfinance.gov/owning-a-home.

YOUR CHOICE
Check one:
$\square$ I prefer a fixed-rate mortgage. OR $\square$ I prefer an adjustable-rate mortgage.

## Check for risky loan features

Some loans are safer and more predictable than others. It is a good idea to make sure you are comfortable with the risks you are taking on when you buy your home. You can find out if you have certain types of risky loan features from the Loan Terms section on the first page of your Loan Estimate.

A balloon payment is a large payment you must make, usually at the end of your loan repayment period. Depending on the terms of your loan, the balloon payment could be as large as the entire balance on your mortgage.

A prepayment penalty is an amount you have to pay if you refinance or pay off your loan early. A prepayment penalty may apply even if you sell your home.

# 4. Choose the right down payment for you 

A down payment is the amount you pay toward the home yourself. You put a percentage of the home's value down and borrow the rest through your mortgage loan.

YOUR CHOICE
Check one:

YOUR DOWN PAYMENT
WHAT THAT MEANS FOR YOU
$\square$ I will put down 20\% or more.

A $20 \%$ or higher down payment likely provides the best rates and most options. However, think twice if the down payment drains all your savings.

I will put down between $5 \%$ and $19 \%$.

You probably have to pay higher interest rates or fees. Lenders most likely require private mortgage insurance (PMI). PMI is an insurance policy that lets you make a lower down payment by insuring the lender against loss if you fail to pay your mortgage.

Keep in mind when you hear about "no PMI" offers that doesn't mean zero cost. No PMI offers often have higher interest rates and may also require you to take out a second mortgage. Be sure you understand the details.

I will make no down payment or a small one of less than $5 \%$.

Low down payment programs are typically more expensive because they may require mortgage insurance or a higher interest rate. Look closely at your total fees, interest rate, and monthly payment when comparing options.

Ask about loan programs such as:

- Conventional loans that may offer low down payment options.
- FHA, which offers a $3.5 \%$ down payment program.
- VA, which offers a zero down payment option for qualifying veterans.
- USDA, which offers a similar zero down payment program for eligible borrowers in rural areas.


## The advantages of prepayment

Prepayment is when you make additional mortgage payments so you pay down your mortgage early. This reduces your overall cost of borrowing, and you may be able to cancel your private mortgage insurance early and stop paying the premium. Especially if your down payment is less than $20 \%$, it may make sense to make additional payments to pay down your loan earlier.

TIP
Prepayment is your choice. You don't have to sign up for a program or pay a fee to set it up.

# 5. Understand the trade-off between points and interest rate 

Points are a percentage of a loan amount. For example, when a loan officer talks about one point on a $\$ 100,000$ loan, the loan officer is talking about one percent of the loan, which equals $\$ 1,000$. Lenders offer different interest rates on loans with different points. There are three main choices you can make about points. You can decide you don't want to pay or receive points at all. This is called a zero point loan. You can pay points at closing to receive a lower interest rate. Or you can choose to have points paid to you (also called lender credits) and use them to cover some of your closing costs.

The example below shows the trade-off between points as part of your closing costs and interest rates. In the example, you borrow $\$ 180,000$ and qualify for a 30 -year fixed-rate loan at an interest rate of $5.0 \%$ with zero points. Rates currently available may be different than what is shown in this example.

COMPARE THREE SCENARIOS OF HOW POINTS AFFECT INTEREST RATE

| RATE | $4.875 \%$ | $5.0 \%$ | $5.125 \%$ |
| :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: |
| POINTS | $+0.375$ | 0 | $-0.375$ |
| YOUR <br> SITUATION | You plan to keep your mortgage for a long time. You can afford to pay more cash at closing. | You are satisfied with the market rate without points in either direction. | You don't want to pay a lot of cash upfront and you can afford a larger mortgage payment. |
| YOU MAY CHOOSE | Pay points now and get a lower interest rate. This will save you money over the long run. | Zero points. | Pay a higher interest rate and get a lender credit toward some or all of your closing costs. |
| WHAT <br> THAT <br> MEANS | You might agree to pay $\$ 675$ more in closing costs, in exchange for a lower rate of $4.875 \%$. <br> Now: You pay \$675 <br> Over the life of the loan: <br> Pay $\$ 14$ less each month | With no adjustments in either direction, it is easier to understand what you're paying and to compare prices. | You might agree to a higher rate of $5.125 \%$, in exchange for $\$ 675$ toward your closing costs. <br> Now: You get $\$ 675$ <br> Over the life of the loan: Pay $\$ 14$ more each month |

## 6. Shop with several lenders

You've figured out what affordable means for you. You've reviewed your credit and the kind of mortgage and down payment that best fits your situation. Now is the time to start shopping seriously for a loan. The work you do here could save you thousands of dollars over the life of your mortgage.

## GATHER FACTS AND COMPARE COSTS

$\square$ Make a list of several lenders you will start with
Mortgages are typically offered by community banks, credit unions, mortgage brokers, online lenders, and large banks. These lenders have loan officers you can talk to about your situation.

## $\square$ Get the facts from the lenders on your list

Find out from the lenders what loan options they recommend for you, and the costs and benefits for each. For example, you might find a discount is offered for borrowers who have completed a home buyer education program.
$\square$ Get at least three offers-in writing-so that you can compare them
Review the decisions you made on pages 4 to 8 to determine the loan type, down payment, total monthly home payment and other features to shop for. Now ask at least three different lenders to give you a Loan Estimate, which is a standard form showing important facts about the loan. It should be sent to you within three days, and it shouldn't be expensive. Lenders can charge you only a small fee for getting your credit report-and some lenders provide the Loan Estimate without that fee.

## Compare Total Loan Costs

Review your Loan Estimates and compare Total Loan Costs, which you can see under Section D at the bottom left of the second page of the Loan Estimate. Total Loan Costs include what your lender charges to make the loan, as well as costs for services such as appraisal and title. The third page of the Loan Estimate shows the Annual Percentage Rate (APR), which is a measure of your costs over the loan term expressed as a rate. Also shown on the third page is the Total Interest Percentage (TIP), which is the total amount of interest that you pay over the loan term as a percentage of your loan amount. You can use APR and TIP to compare loan offers.

## RESEARCH STARTER

Loan costs can vary widely from lender to lender, so this is one place where a little research may help you save a lot of money. Here's how:
$\square$ Ask real estate and title professionals about average costs in your area.
$\square$ Learn more about loan costs, and get help comparing options, at consumerfinance.gov/owning-a-home.

TIP
A loan officer is not necessarily shopping on your behalf or providing you with the best fit or lowest cost loan.

TIP
It is illegal for a lender to pay a loan officer more to steer you into a higher cost loan.

# THE TALK 

Talking to different lenders helps you to know what options are available and to feel more in control. Here is one way to start the conversation:
"This mortgage is a big decision and I want to get it right. Another lender is offering me a different loan that may cost less. Let's talk about what the differences are and whether you may be able to offer me the best deal."

## TRACK YOUR LOAN OFFERS

Fill in the blanks for these important factors:

| LOAN OFFER 1 | LOAN OFFER 2 | LOAN OFFER 3 |
| :--: | :--: | :--: |
| Lender name |  |  |
| Loan amount | \$ | \$ |
| Interest rate | \% | \% |

| Monthly principal and interest | \$ | \$ |
| Monthly mortgage insurance | \$ | \$ |
| Total Loan Costs (See section D on the second page of your Loan Estimate.) | \$ | \$ |

My best loan offer is:

# 7. Choose your mortgage 

You've done a lot of hard work to get this far! Now it is time to make your call.

## CONFIRM YOUR DECISION <br> Check the box if you agree with the statement:

$\square$ I can repay this loan.
$\square$ I am comfortable with my monthly payment.
$\square$ I shopped enough to know this is a good deal for me.
$\square$ There are no risky features such as a balloon payment or prepayment penalty I can't handle down the road.

I know whether my principal and interest payment will increase in the future.

Still need advice? The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) sponsors housing counseling agencies throughout the country to provide free or low-cost advice. To find a HUD-approved housing counselor visit consumerfinance.gov/find-a-housing-counselor or call HUD's interactive voice system at (800) 569-4287.

## Intent to proceed

When you receive a Loan Estimate, the lender has not yet approved or denied your loan. Up to this point, they are showing you what they expect to offer if you decide to move forward with your application. You have not committed to this lender. In fact, you are not committed to any lender before you have signed final closing documents.

Once you have found your best mortgage, the next step is to tell the loan officer you want to proceed with that mortgage application. This is called expressing your intent to proceed. Lenders have to wait until you express your intent to proceed before they require you to pay an application fee, appraisal fee, or most other fees.

## Rate lock

Your Loan Estimate may show a rate that has been "locked" or a rate that is "floating," which means it can go up or down. Mortgage interest rates change daily, sometimes hourly. A rate lock sets your interest rate for a period of time. Rate locks are typically available for 30,45 , or 60 days, and sometimes longer.

The interest rate on your Loan Estimate is not a guarantee. If your rate is floating and it is later locked, your interest rate will be set at that later time. Also, if there are changes in your application-including your loan amount, credit score, or verified income-your rate and terms will probably change too. In those situations, the lender gives you a revised Loan Estimate.

There can be a downside to a rate lock. It may be expensive to extend if your transaction needs more time. And, a rate lock may lock you out of better market pricing if rates fall.

# THE TALK 

Rate lock policies vary by lender. Choosing to lock or float your rate can make an important difference in your monthly payment. To avoid surprises, ask:
"What does it mean if I lock my rate today?"
"What rate lock time frame does this Loan Estimate provide?"
"Is a shorter or longer rate lock available, and at what cost?"
"What if my closing is delayed and the rate lock expires?"
"If I lock my rate, are there any conditions under which my rate could still change?"

# 8. Avoid pitfalls 

| WHAT NOT TO DO | WHY? |
| :--: | :--: |
| Don't sign documents where important details are left blank or documents you don't understand. | You are agreeing to repay a substantial amount of money over an extended period of time. Make sure you know what you are getting into and protect yourself from fraud. |
| Don't assume you are on your own. | HUD-approved housing counselors can help you navigate the process and find programs available to help first-time homebuyers. <br> You can find a HUD-approved housing counselor in your area at consumerfinance.gov/find-a-housing-counselor or call HUD's interactive voice system at (800) 569-4287. |
| Don't take on more mortgage than you want or can afford. | Make certain that you want the loan that you are requesting and that you are in a position to live up to your end of the bargain. |
| Don't count on refinancing, and don't take out a loan if you already know you will have to change it later. | If you are not comfortable with the loan offered to you, ask your lender if there is another option that works for you. Keep looking until you find the right loan for your situation. |
| Don't fudge numbers or documents. | You are responsible for an accurate and truthful application. Be upfront about your situation. Mortgage fraud is a serious offense. |
| Don't hide important financial information. | Hiding negative information may delay or derail your loan application. |

# Handle problems 

WHAT HAPPENED
I have experienced a problem with my loan application or how my loan officer is treating me.

I think I was unlawfully discriminated against when I applied for a loan or when I tried to buy a home.

## WHAT TO DO ABOUT IT

Ask to talk to a supervisor. It may be a good idea to talk to the loan officer first, and if you are not satisfied, ask to speak with a supervisor.

The Fair Housing Act and Equal Credit Opportunity Act prohibit housing and credit discrimination. If you think you have been discriminated against during any part of the mortgage process, you can submit a complaint and describe what happened. To do so, you can call the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau at (855) 411-2372 or visit consumerfinance.gov/complaint. Submit a complaint to the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) by calling (800) 669-9777, TTY (800) 9279275. Or, file a complaint online at HUD.gov.

You can find more information about your rights and how to submit a complaint with the CFPB at consumerfinance.gov/fair-lending.

Submit a complaint to the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau if you have problems at any stage of the mortgage application or closing process, or later if you have problems making payments or become unable to pay. You can call (855) 411-2372 or visit consumerfinance.gov/complaint.

Don't believe anyone who tells you they are your "only chance to get a loan," or that you must "act fast." Learn the warning signs of predatory lending and protect yourself. Find more information at portal.hud.gov/hudportal/HUD?src=/program_ offices/housing/sfh/hcc/OHC_PREDLEND/OHC_LOANFRAUD.

# Your closing 

You've chosen a mortgage. Now it's time to select and work with your closing agent.

## IN THIS SECTION

1. Shop for mortgage closing services
2. Review your revised Loan Estimate
3. Understand and use your Closing Disclosure

## 1. Shop for mortgage closing services

Once you've decided to move forward with a lender based on the Loan Estimate, you are ready to shop for the closing agent who gathers all the legal documents, closes the loan, and handles the money involved in your purchase. After you apply for a loan, your lender gives you a list of companies that provide closing services. You may want to use one of the companies on the list. Or, you may be able to choose companies that are not on the list if your lender agrees to work with your choice. The seller cannot require you to buy a title insurance policy from a particular title company.

## Closing agent

In most of the country, a settlement agent does your closing. In other states, particularly several states in the West, the person is known as an escrow agent. And in some states, particularly in the Northeast and South, an attorney may be required.

## RESEARCH STARTER

When you compare closing agents, look at both cost and customer service.
$\square$ Ask your real estate professional and your friends. These people may know companies they would recommend. Be sure to ask how that company handled problems and if they have a good reputation,

$\square$ Review the list of companies your lender gave you. Select a few companies on the list and ask for references from people who recently bought a home. Ask those people how the company handled problems that came up during the transaction.

# Title insurance 

When you purchase your home, you receive a document most often called a deed, which shows the seller transferred their legal ownership, or "title," to the home to you. Title insurance can provide protection if someone later sues and says they have a claim against the home. Common claims come from a previous owner's failure to pay taxes or from contractors who say they were not paid for work done on the home before you purchased it.

Most lenders require a Lender's Title Insurance policy, which protects the amount they lent. You may want to buy an Owner's Title Insurance policy, which protects your financial investment in the home. The Loan Estimate you receive lists the Owner's Title Insurance policy as optional if your lender does not require the policy as a condition of the loan.

Depending on the state where you are buying your home, your title insurance company may give you an itemized list of fees at closing. This itemized list may be required under state law and may be different from what you see on your Loan Estimate or Closing Disclosure. That does not mean you are being charged more. If you add up all the title-related costs your title insurance company gives you, it should match the totals of all the title-related costs you see on your Loan Estimate or Closing Disclosure. When comparing costs for title insurance, make sure to compare the bottom line total.

## Home inspector and home appraiser

When you are considering buying a home, it is smart to check it out carefully to see if it is in good condition. The person who does this for you is called a home inspector. The inspector works for you and should tell you whether the home you want to buy is in good condition and whether you are buying a "money pit" of expensive repairs. Get your inspection before you are finally committed to buy the home.

A home inspector is different from a home appraiser. The appraiser is an independent professional whose job is to give the lender an estimate of the home's market value. You are entitled to a copy of the appraisal prior to your closing. This allows you to see how the price you agreed to pay compares to similar and recent property sales in your area.

# 2. Review your revised Loan Estimate 

When important information changes, your lender is required to give you a new Loan Estimate that shows your new loan offer.

It is illegal for a lender to quote you low fees and costs for its services on your Loan Estimate and then surprise you with much higher costs in a revised Loan Estimate or Closing Disclosure. However, a lender may change the fees it quotes you for its services if the facts on your application were wrong or changed, you asked for a change, your lender found you did not qualify for the original loan offer, or your Loan Estimate expired.

Here are common reasons why your Loan Estimate might change:

- You decided to change loan programs or the amount of your down payment.
- The appraisal on the home you want to buy came in higher or lower than expected.
- You took out a new loan or missed a payment and that has changed your credit.
- Your lender could not document your overtime, bonus, or other income.


## THE TALK

If your Loan Estimate is revised you should look it over to see what changed. Ask your lender:
"Can you explain why I received a new Loan Estimate?"
"How is my loan transaction different from what I was originally expecting?"
"How does this change my loan amount, interest rate, monthly payment, cash to close, and other loan features?"

# 3. Understand and use your Closing Disclosure 

You've chosen a home you want to buy and your offer has been accepted. You've also applied for and been approved for a mortgage. Now you are ready to take legal possession of the home and promise to repay your loan.

At least three days before your closing, you should get your official Closing Disclosure, which is a five-page document that gives you more details about your loan, its key terms, and how much you are paying in fees and other costs to get your mortgage and buy your home.

Many of the costs you pay at closing are set by the decisions you made when you were shopping for a mortgage. Charges shown under "services you can shop for" may increase at closing, but generally by no more than $10 \%$ of the costs listed on your final Loan Estimate.

The Closing Disclosure breaks down your closing costs into two big categories:

## YOUR LOAN COSTS

- The lender's Origination Costs to make or "originate" the loan, along with application fees and fees to underwrite your loan. Underwriting is the lender's term for making sure your credit and financial information is accurate and you meet the lender's requirements for a loan.
- Discount points-that is, additional money you pay up front to reduce your interest rate.
- Services you shopped for, such as your closing or settlement agent and related title costs.
- Services your lender requires for your loan. These include appraisals and credit reports.


## OTHER COSTS

- Property taxes.
- Homeowner's insurance premiums. You can shop around for homeowner's insurance from your current insurance company, or many others, until you find the combination of premium, coverage, and customer service that fits your situation. Your lender will ask you for proof you have an insurance policy on your new home.
- Any portion of your total mortgage payment you must make before your first full payment is due.
- Flood insurance, if required.


## RESEARCH STARTER

Get tips, a step-by-step checklist, and help with the rest of the documents you'll see at closing at consumerfinance.gov/owning-a-home.

## What is your Closing Disclosure?

The five-page Closing Disclosure sums up the terms of your loan and what you pay at closing. You can easily compare the numbers to the Loan Estimate you received earlier. There should not be any significant changes other than those you have already agreed to.

Take out your own Closing Disclosure, or review the example here. Double-check that you clearly understand what you'll be expected to pay-over the life of your loan and at closing.

## ON PAGE 1 OF 5

## Loan terms

Review your monthly payment. Part of it goes to repay what you borrowed (and may build equity in your new home), and part of it goes to pay interest (which doesn't build equity). Equity is the current market value of your home minus the amount you still owe on your mortgage.

## Costs at Closing

Be prepared to bring the full "Cash to Close" amount with you to your closing. This amount includes your down payment and closing costs. The closing costs are itemized on the following pages.
![img-273.jpeg](img-273.jpeg)

Closing Disclosure, page 1. The most important facts about your loan are on the first page.

## ON PAGE 2 OF 5

## Total Loan Costs

Origination charges are fees your lender charges to make your loan. Some closing costs are fees paid to the providers selected by your lender. Some are fees you pay to providers you chose on your own.

## Prepaids

Homeowner's insurance is often paid in advance for the first full year. Also, some taxes and other fees need to be paid in advance.

![img-274.jpeg](img-274.jpeg)

# Escrow 

An escrow or impound account is a special account where monthly insurance and tax payments are held until they are paid out each year. You get a statement showing how much money your lender or mortgage servicer plans to require for your escrow or impound account.

You also get an annual analysis showing what happened to the money in your account. Your lender must follow federal rules to make sure they do not end up with a large surplus or shortage in your escrow or impound account.

The interest rate is what I was expecting based on my Loan Estimate.
YES / NO (see page 10)
I know whether I have a prepayment penalty or balloon payment.
YES / NO (see page 7)
I know whether or not my payment changes in future years.
YES / NO (see page 7)
I see whether I am paying points or receiving points at closing.
YES / NO (see page 9)
I know whether I have an escrow account.
YES / NO (see above)

## Calculating Cash to Close

Closing costs are only a part of the total cash you need to bring to closing.

## Summaries of Transactions

The section at the bottom of the page sums up how the money flows among you, the lender, and the seller.

## ON PAGE 4 OF 5

## Loan Disclosures

Page 4 breaks down what is and is not included in your escrow or impound account. Make sure you understand what is paid from your escrow account and what you are responsible for paying yourself.

## Additional Information About This Loan

![img-276.jpeg](img-276.jpeg)

![img-277.jpeg](img-277.jpeg)

Loan calculations, disclosures, and contact information for your files are on page 5 of the Closing Disclosure.

## NOW

- Now you've spent time understanding what you need to do and what you need to pay, as a new homeowner.
- Now is the time to step back and feel sure you want to proceed with the loan.


## ON PAGE 5 OF 5

## Finance Charge

In addition to paying back the amount you are borrowing, you pay a lot of interest over the life of the loan. This is why it is worthwhile to shop carefully for the best loan for your situation.

## Annual Percentage Rate (APR)

Your APR is your total cost of credit stated as a rate. Your APR is generally higher than your interest rate, because the APR takes into consideration all the costs of your loan, over the full term of the loan.

If anything on the Closing Disclosure is not clear to you, ask your lender or settlement agent, "What does this mean?"

## NOW

- Now you've spent time understanding what you need to do and what you need to pay, as a new homeowner.
- Now is the time to step back and feel sure you want to proceed with the loan.


## IN THE FUTURE

- If you are not comfortable with your mortgage and your responsibility to make payments, you might not be able to keep your home.
- If you've made a careful decision about what you can afford and the mortgage you wanted, you will be able to balance owning your home and meeting your other financial goals.

# Owning your home 

(1)Now you've closed on your mortgage and the home is yours.

Owning a home is exciting. And your home is also a large investment. Here's how to protect that investment.

## 1. Act fast if you get behind on your payments

If you fall behind on your mortgage, the company that accepts payments on your mortgage contacts you. This company is your mortgage servicer. Your servicer is required to let you know what options are available to avoid foreclosure. Talk to your mortgage servicer if you get into trouble, and call a housing counselor (see page 12 for contact information). HUD-approved counselors are professionals who can help you, often at little or no charge to you.

Homeowners struggling to pay a mortgage should beware of scammers promising to lower mortgage payments. Only your mortgage servicer can evaluate you for a loan modification. If you suspect a scam you can call (855) 411-2372 or visit consumerfinance.gov/complaint.

## 2. Keep up with ongoing costs

Your mortgage payment is just one part of what it costs to live in your new home. Your escrow account holds your monthly taxes and homeowner's insurance payments--but if you have no escrow account, you need to keep up with these on your own. Your home needs maintenance and repairs, so budget and save for these too.

# 3. Determine if you need flood insurance 

Flooding causes more than $\$ 8$ billion in damages in the United States in an average year. You can protect your home and its contents from flood damage. Depending on your property location, your home is considered either at high-risk or at moderate-to-low risk for a flood. Your insurance premium varies accordingly. You can find out more about flood insurance at FloodSmart.gov. Private flood insurance could also be available.

Although you may not be required to maintain flood insurance on all structures, you may still wish to do so, and your mortgage lender may still require you to do so to protect the collateral securing the mortgage. If you choose to not maintain flood insurance on a structure, and it floods, you are responsible for all flood losses relating to that structure.

## 4. Understand Home Equity Lines of Credit (HELOCs) and refinancing

Homeowners sometimes decide they want to borrow against the value of their home to help remodel or pay for other large expenses. One way to do this is with a Home Equity Line of Credit (HELOC). You can learn more about HELOCs at files.consumerfinance.gov/f/201401_cfpb_booklet_heloc.pdf.

Financial counselors caution homeowners against using a HELOC to wipe out credit card debt. If you use a HELOC as a quick fix to a serious spending problem, you could end up back in debt and lose your home.

If you decide to take out a HELOC or refinance your mortgage, the Truth in Lending Act (TILA) gives you the right to rescind, meaning you can change your mind and cancel the loan. But you can only rescind a refinance or HELOC within three days of receiving a proper notice of the right to rescind from your lender. You cannot rescind if you are using your HELOC to buy a home.

In the case of a refinance, consider how long it will take for the monthly savings to pay for the cost of the refinance. Review the closing costs you paid for your original loan to purchase the home. Refinancing costs can be about the same amount. A common rule of thumb is to proceed only if the new interest rate saves you that amount over about two years (in other words, if you break even in about two years).

## Congratulations!

You have accomplished a lot. It is not easy-you should feel proud of the work you've done.

Re: $\quad 2^{\text {nd }}$ LOE on Two large deposits: 9-26-16 and 3-6-17
This Second LOE is written in response to questions regarding two large deposits into our personal account on 9-26-16 and 3-6-17.

The deposit on 9-26-16 came from a client (Thomas O'Toole) who owed us money from his divorce case. We are also representing him on a pending appeal before the First District Court of Appeal in San Francisco pertaining to the divorce case. We will order a copy of the deposited check for you. Once we received the money, we invested it.

The deposit on 3-6-17 was not a "single" deposit from one client; it was a deposit from a combination of checks/payments we collected from several clients in February and March when we were collecting outstanding bills. We also accept money from clients via Pay Pal, and part of the monies included in the 3-6-17 deposit was from clients who paid via Pay Pal. The monies first went into our business account $\# 6729$ in February and early March, and then I made one transfer from business checking $\# 6729$ to personal checking $\# 6737$. Copies of those checks/deposit slips/pay pal payments that made up the 3-6-17 deposit into business and then to personal are attached.

At Comerica, the "transfer" from business checking to personal checking has to be an "in person" in the branch withdrawal from the business account and then a deposit into the personal account because those accounts have 2 different EINs (business and personal), and Comerica's system will not allow us to link the accounts on-line yet because of the 2 different EINs.

# PLEASE CONFIRM RECEIPT. 

Hi David - attached are the deposit and withdrawal slips for 3-6-17 and 3-7-17.
As you can see, I physically withdrew $\$ 100,000$ from the business account \# ${ }^{\text {2020 }}$ on 3-6-17 and deposited the money into the personal account \# ${ }^{\text {2037 }}$ on the same day.
Unfortunately, the bank teller must have incorrectly entered the deposit as $\$ 1,000$ on 3-6-17 in her system. Look at the post amount on the bottom part of the deposit slip on 3-6-17.

The bank then corrected this error on 3-7-17 when they audited the account and saw the teller had inputted the incorrect amount; the bank then generated the "Credit Advice" form and credited the account the additional \$99,000 on 3-7-17.

This is why the bank statement shows a deposit of $\$ 1,000$ on 3-6 and a deposit of $\$ 99,000$ on 3-7. They were actually part of the same deposit.

I never knew any of this until today when you asked me to get the slips. When I noticed the extra "Credit Advice" slip, I asked my personal banker what happened and that is the story he told me. Makes sense to me. Let me know if you need anything else.

Sincerely,

Dear Nicole:
I need to send you an updated payoff statement because Mr. Lopez owes Dr. Chee $\$ 175,650.00$ instead of $\$ 175,610$. There were additional charges that I had to add to the payoff statement.

Dear Nicole:
I think I sent you a Substitution of Trustee and Full Recon last year. As you can see, this refinance escrow is more like a career escrow. We've waited so long for this to close, so pardon me if I am not jumping through hoops to get this done, but here is the demand for payoff on our form since a new demand was not attached for up-to-date numbers. The only thing that changed was the loan is paid to May 1st, 2017, so interest will be collected from May 1st to and including the close of escrow day.

Thank you,
Diane

# NON-ASSUMABILITY NOTE ADDENDUM (ADJUSTABLE RATE) 

THIS NON-ASSUMABILITY NOTE ADDENDUM (the "Addendum") is made this 25th and is incorporated into and shall be deemed to amend and supplement the note made by the undersigned Borrower, ("I", "me", "my") to evidence my indebtedness (the "Loan") to LendSure Mortgage Corp., a Corporation
and its successors and assigns (the "Note Holder") and dated the same date as this Addendum (the "Note"). The Note is secured by a security instrument, as modified or amended, in favor of the Lender dated the same date as this Addendum (the "Security Instrument"). All terms defined in the Note shall have the same meaning in this Addendum.

ADDITIONAL COVENANTS. In addition to the covenants and agreements made in the Note, Note Holder and I further covenant and agree as follows:

Section 11 of the Note entitled "UNIFORM SECURED NOTE" is hereby deleted in its entirety and replaced with the following provisions:

## 11. UNIFORM SECURED NOTE

The Note is a uniform instrument with limited variations in some jurisdictions. In addition to the protections given to the Note Holder under the Note, a Mortgage, Deed of Trust, or Security Deed (the "Security Instrument"), dated the same date as the Note, protects the Note Holder from possible losses which might result if I do not keep the promises which I make in the Note. That Security Instrument describes how and under what conditions I may be required to make immediate payment in full of all amounts I owe under the Note. Some of those conditions are described as follows:

If all or any part of the Property or any Interest in the Property is sold or transferred (or if Borrower is not a natural person and a beneficial interest in Borrower is sold or transferred) without Lender's prior written consent, Lender may require immediate payment in full of all sums secured by this Security Instrument. However, this option shall not be exercised by Lender if such exercise is prohibited by Applicable Law.

If Lender exercises this option, Lender shall give Borrower notice of acceleration. The notice shall provide a period of not less than 30 days from the date the notice is given in accordance with Section 15 within which Borrower must pay all sums secured by this Security Instrument. If Borrower fails to pay these sums prior to the expiration of this period, Lender may invoke any remedies permitted by this Security Instrument without further notice or demand on Borrower.

BY SIGNING BELOW, I accept and agree to the terms and covenants contained in this Addendum.

# Notice of Special Flood Hazards and Availability of Federal Disaster Relief Assistance 

Notice is Given By: LENDSURE MORTGAGE CORPORATION To: Lopez Augustine<br>Property Location: 1069 Lake Drive<br>DANVILLE, CA 94526-5146

Loan Number: CASDW175551609
Order Number: 4532104789
Determination Date: 05/02/2017

## Notice of Property IN Special Flood Hazard Area (SFHA)

The building or mobile home securing the loan for which you have applied is or will be located in an area with special flood hazards. The area has been identified by the Administrator of the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) as a special flood hazard area using FEMA's Flood Insurance Rate Map or the Flood Hazard Boundary Map for the following community:
DANVILLE, TOWN OF - 06013C0461F
This area has a one percent ( $1 \%$ ) chance of a flood equal to or exceeding the base flood elevation (a 100-year flood) in any given year. During the life of a 30-year mortgage loan, the risk of a 100-year flood in a special flood hazard area is 26 percent (26\%). Federal law allows a lender and borrower jointly to request the Administrator of FEMA to review the determination of whether the property securing the loan is located in a special flood hazard area. If you would like to make such a request, please contact us for further information.

Escrow Requirement for Residential Loans: Federal law may require a lender or its servicer to escrow all premiums and fees for flood insurance that covers any residential building or mobile home securing a loan that is located in an area with special flood hazards. If your lender notifies you that an escrow account is required for your loan, then you must pay your flood insurance premiums and fees to the lender or its servicer with the same frequency as you make loan payments for the duration of your loan. These premiums and fees will be deposited in the escrow account, which will be used to pay the flood insurance provider.

## Notice of Property in a Participating Community

The community in which the property securing the loan is located participates in the National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP). Federal law will not allow us to make you the loan that you have applied for if you do not purchase flood insurance. The flood insurance must be maintained for the life of the loan. If you fail to purchase or renew flood insurance on the property, Federal law authorizes and requires us to purchase the flood insurance for you at your expense.
$\infty$ At a minimum, flood insurance purchased must cover the lesser of:
(1) the outstanding principal balance of the loan; or
(2) the maximum amount of coverage allowed for the type of property under the NFIP.
$\infty$ Flood insurance coverage under the NFIP is limited to the building or mobile home and any personal property that secures your loan and not the land itself.
$\infty$ Federal disaster relief assistance (usually in the form of a low-interest loan) may be available for damages incurred in excess of your flood insurance if your community's participation in the NFIP is in accordance with NFIP requirements.
$\infty$ Although you may not be required to maintain flood insurance on all structures, you may still wish to do so, and your mortgage lender may still require you to do so to protect the collateral securing the mortgage. If you choose not to maintain flood insurance on a structure and it floods, you are responsible for all flood losses relating to that structure.
$\infty$ Availability of Private Flood Insurance Coverage: Flood insurance coverage under the NFIP may be purchased through an insurance agent who will obtain the policy either directly through the NFIP or through an insurance company that participates in the NFIP. Flood insurance that provides the same level of coverage as a standard flood insurance policy under the NFIP may be available from private insurers that do not participate in the NFIP. You should compare the flood insurance coverage, deductibles, exclusions, conditions and premiums associated with flood insurance policies issued on behalf of the NFIP and policies issued on behalf of private insurance companies and contact an insurance agent as to the availability, cost, and comparisons of flood insurance coverage.

## Notice of Property in a Non-Participating Community

Flood insurance coverage under the NFIP is not available for the property securing the loan because the community in which the property is located does not participate in the NFIP.

# FLOOD HAZARD DETERMINATION 

Date: May 25, 2017
Borrower(s) Name(s): Augustine M Lopez

Property Address: 1069 Lake Drive

Danville, CA 94526

Pursuant to federal regulations, the Lender has evaluated whether or not the improved real property or mobile home (the "Property") which will secure your loan is located in an area designated by the Federal Emergency Management Agency ("FEMA") as a "Special Flood Hazard Area." The Lender has determined that according to FEMA the Property is NOT located in a designated Special Flood Hazard Area. Therefore, flood insurance will NOT be required by the Lender as a condition of closing this loan transaction.

The National Flood Insurance Reform Act of 1994 provides that if the loan servicer at any time during the term of the loan determines that the Property is in a Special Flood Hazard Area the loan servicer must notify the borrower that flood insurance must be obtained. In these cases, the borrower has 45 days to respond and provide evidence of acceptable insurance to the loan servicer; if no response is made by the borrower, the loan servicer can force-place flood insurance after 45 days from the date of notification.

The undersigned Borrower(s) agree that flood insurance will be purchased if the Property is located in a Special Flood Hazard Area, and if flood insurance is available in the community. The undersigned Borrower(s) further agree that if the Property at any time is determined to be in a Special Flood Hazard Area, and if insurance is available, Borrower(s) will obtain and pay for such insurance in an amount as required by the Lender of loan servicer.

# PLANNED UNIT DEVELOPMENT RIDER 

THIS PLANNED UNIT DEVELOPMENT RIDER is made this 25th day of May, 2017 and is incorporated into and shall be deemed to amend and supplement the Mortgage, Deed of Trust or Security Deed (the "Security Instrument") of the same date, given by the undersigned (the "Borrower") to secure Borrower's Note to LendSure Mortgage Corp., a Corporation
(the "Lender")
of the same date and covering the Property described in the Security Instrument and located at: 1000 Lake Drive

Danville, CA 94526.

The Property includes, but is not limited to, a parcel of land improved with a dwelling, together with other such parcels and certain common areas and facilities, as described in COVENANTS, CONDITIONS AND RESTRICTIONS

Association. Borrower shall promptly pay, when due, all dues and assessments imposed pursuant to the Constituent Documents.
B. Property Insurance. So long as the Owners Association maintains, with a generally accepted insurance carrier, a "master" or "blanket" policy insuring the Property which is satisfactory to Lender and which provides insurance coverage in the amounts (including deductible levels), for the periods, and against loss by fire, hazards included within the term "extended coverage," and any other hazards, including, but not limited to, earthquakes and floods, for which Lender requires insurance, then: (i) Lender waives the provision in Section 3 for the Periodic Payment to Lender of the yearly premium installments for property insurance on the Property; and (ii) Borrower's obligation under Section 5 to maintain property insurance coverage on the Property is deemed satisfied to the extent that the required coverage is provided by the Owners Association policy.

What Lender requires as a condition of this waiver can change during the term of the loan.

Borrower shall give Lender prompt notice of any lapse in required property insurance coverage provided by the master or blanket policy.

In the event of a distribution of property insurance proceeds in lieu of restoration or repair following a loss to the Property, or to common areas and facilities of the PUD, any proceeds payable to Borrower are hereby assigned and shall be paid to Lender. Lender shall apply the proceeds to the sums secured by the Security Instrument, whether or not then due, with the excess, if any, paid to Borrower.
C. Public Liability Insurance. Borrower shall take such actions as may be reasonable to ensure that the Owners Association maintains a public liability insurance policy acceptable in form, amount, and extent of coverage to Lender.
D. Condemnation. The proceeds of any award or claim for damages, direct or consequential, payable to Borrower in connection with any condemnation or other taking of all or any part of the Property or the common areas and facilities of the PUD, or for any conveyance in lieu of condemnation, are hereby assigned and shall be paid to Lender. Such proceeds shall be applied by Lender to the sums secured by the Security Instrument as provided in Section 11.
E. Lender's Prior Consent. Borrower shall not, except after notice to Lender and with Lender's prior written consent, either partition or subdivide the Property or consent to: (i) the abandonment or termination of the PUD, except for abandonment or termination required by law in the case of substantial destruction by fire or other casualty or in the case of a taking by condemnation or eminent domain; (ii) any amendment to any provision of the "Constituent Documents" if the provision is for the express benefit of Lender; (iii) termination of professional management and assumption of

F. Remedies. If Borrower does not pay PUD dues and assessments when due, then Lender may pay them. Any amounts disbursed by Lender under this paragraph $F$ shall become additional debt of Borrower secured by the Security Instrument. Unless Borrower and Lender agree to other terms of payment, these amounts shall bear interest from the date of disbursement at the Note rate and shall be payable, with interest, upon notice from Lender to Borrower requesting payment.

# NOTICE 

Section 12413.1 of the California Insurance Code, effective January 1, 1990, requires that any title insurance company, underwritten title company, or controlled escrow company handling funds in an escrow or sub-escrow capacity, wait a specified number of days after depositing funds, before recording any documents in connection with the transaction or disbursing funds. This statute allows for funds deposited by wire transfer to be disbursed the same day as deposit. In the case of cashier's checks or certified checks, funds may be disbursed the next day after deposit. In order to avoid unnecessary delays of three to seven days, or more, please use wire transfer, cashier's checks, or certified checks whenever possible.

# DETAILS: 

Tier 1, Bank Statements, O/O, R/T Refi, PUD, \$1,050,000 value, \$780,000 loan amount, 74.28\% LTV.

Borrowers purchased the subject property 8/2015 for $\$ 875,000$ and appears they rented the house previous to purchasing it. Refinancing 3 private party lenders into one loan ( $1^{\text {st }}=8 \%, 2^{\text {nd }}$ $=10 \%) .1^{\text {St }}$ mortgage is a balloon that was due August 2016, however, borrowers paid an extension fee which is documented with cancelled checks. Lowering housing payment by over $\$ 800 /$ mo. Both borrowers are self-employed as Lawyers/Lopez Law. Income derived from a 24 month average of personal bank statements. Mortgages appear to be paid AA (missing some info) and consumer credit is paid very good. Borrowers will have to come in with approximately $\$ 31,000$ cash to close. Current housing payment $=\$ 7328.02 / \mathrm{mo}$.

Proposed Housing Payment $=\$ 6657.62 / \mathrm{mo}$.
Consumer Debt $=\$ 1141 /$ mo.

Purchase contract in the file showing it was purchased in the name of the business (Lopez Law) and bank statement in file showing paid from business account.

No public Records. Requested co-borrower's driver's license to confirm date of birth as there is a discrepancy noted by TQL Report and Credit Report. Inquiries to be addressed with LOE along with employment showing on credit. The address of 696 San Ramon Valley Blvd. appears to be a former business address (P.O. Box) as it is a strip mall.

# INCOME: 

Borrowers are both lawyers and self-employed as Lopez Law, LLP. Copies of State of CA Bar status in file show Augustine as active bar member since 2004 and Mamista since 2005 and both showing Lopez Law. We are using 24 months of personal bank statements (Comerica \#4127) to qualify with no expense factor since they are personal statements. Two large deposits ( $\$ 99 \mathrm{~K}$ \& \$100K) have been included in the average. LOE in file for the large deposits with supporting documentation of the $\$ 99,000$ deposit. $\$ 100 \mathrm{~K}$ deposit is explained and we conclude that is more than reasonable for two attorneys in CA to be making $\$ 18,000 / \mathrm{mo}$. with no further documentation needed. Bank statements for one of the business accounts (Comerica \#1270) have also been provided as some of the transfers we are using are from this account and we are allowing those transfers as income. Did not request Jan/Feb 2017 on the \#1270 account as there were no transfers in those months. 3 months business statement from account \#2171 provided to show this account is used to pay expenses.

# LETTER OF EXPLANATION 

| DATE: | November 18, 2016 |
| :-- | :-- |
| TO: | David |
| FROM: | Lambert |
| REGARDING | DECEMBER, 2015 PAYMENT - Lopez FILE |

In response to your request for verification the December, 2015 payment was made, the original check sent by Mr. Lopez was lost by the Walnut Creek Post Office that serves our neighborhood. When we notified Mr. Lopez we had not received his payment two weeks after it was due, Mr. Lopez personally delivered at check to replace the missing payment. The replacement check was deposited on December 19, 2015.

Two months later, we received the original envelope with the missing check that I shredded. The envelope was obviously dropped on the floor as it was dirty and covered with footprints.

Other than that payment, Mr. Lopez has never been late nor has he ever missed a payment. The delayed payment for the December, 2015 payment was the fault of the Walnut Creek Post Office and not due to any neligence on Mr. Lopez part.

Please feel free to contact me at 925.705 if you require more information.
